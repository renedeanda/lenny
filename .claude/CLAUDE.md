**Validation:**
- Run `npm run build:verified` after curation

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Visual Design
- **Background:** Pure black (`#000000`)
- **Primary:** Amber/gold (`#ffb347`)
- **Secondary:** Crimson (`#dc143c`)
- **Typography:** Monospace (terminal vibes)
- **Effects:** Scanlines, glitch, glow

### Data Philosophy
- **Real over fake:** Every quote is verifiable
- **Grounded in transcripts:** No made-up insights
- **Timestamp accuracy:** Link to exact moments
- **Quality over quantity:** Better to curate fewer high-quality episodes than many mediocre ones

### UX Philosophy
- **Smooth and delightful:** Animations everywhere
- **Outside the box:** Not typical SV aesthetic
- **Mystery:** Exploratory experience
- **No fluff:** Direct, honest, terminal-style
