Likewise, if you're just feeling like you're a little emotionally overcome, I think coaches are this great resource around that, but it's actually better to pay it forward and build a tribe and a community of people around you that you can rely on for support because that's the thing that lasts you for years and years.",

Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question.

What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you.

It's easier to learn. So that's the product today. It is I think one of the more easier IDEs/ environment/deployment environment on the internet, and I think we make it really easy for people to just jump in even without prior experience of coding, especially now with the new AI products that we built.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

Who might this person also benefit from speaking with? Let's route them to this person that specializes in body-based work, somatic work. Let's send this person to somebody that specializes in nervous system management through breath work or other things.\" So seeking a therapist is a pretty good first step.\n\nLenny",

You're two, three, four, five years old and the world around you, namely the adults in the world, start telling you who to be, and it begins to challenge or run into conflict with that individuality, but because our fear of not being accepted and loved is so great that what do we end up doing?

You don't save anything for the return home, I think is the point. Instead of pursuing my life now as a mountain to be climbed in the hopes that reaching the top will make me feel good again, I'm instead trying to float down river. So for example, if you go whitewater rafting, they'll give you a little safety crash course at the beginning. They'll say, \"Here's how you paddle. Put your vest on.\" One of the things they'll ask you is, what do I do if I fall overboard, especially if I fall overboard into the rapids or the cold water? This is maybe the most important thing they teach because commonly what happens if you're in sizable enough rapids and you fall overboard, the tendency is to freak out and to fight the current. When people freak out in the water, especially when the water's choppy, that's when they get in trouble.",

But if we get those opinions independently, you will actually hear that I think it's going to take four weeks. You may tend to be more right there being more senior, but I may have something interesting to say. You should hear what I have to say. And this also allows me to learn from you, too. But because I haven't heard your opinion first, then I'm not going to conform my opinion to yours.

But the one thing that comes out from this framework is that you can use it for a whole bunch of other things. You can use it for negotiation, for example, because you start with a date, and then you say, \"This is the one-pager that I need to ship, and I want the consumers to see that.\" You can use it to now go to our VP Engineering and say, \"By this date, can we build all of this?\" Now, they do not have all the PRDs and everything, but they can give you a sense that this is too aggressive or this is not and so on.",

It is very low. It's in the two, two and a half thousand dollar range compared to US which is maybe 30 times more and so on. So while there's a lot of people who are going to give you traffic, and engagement, and so on, but the craft of actually choosing the right kind of paying customer who will actually come, and engage, and give you money is at a premium. So a lot harder work needs to be done. If you're running e-commerce, who are the people who will pay me delivery fee? Who are the people who will actually buy this expensive stuff? So a whole bunch of different ways of thinking has evolved in this country, and that's why it's so vibrant and so different than any other global products.\n\nLenny",

We did kind of need this transition from normal pre-training to reinforcement learning scaling up to continue the scaling laws, but I think it's kind of like for semiconductors where it's less about the density of transistors that you can fit on a chip and more about how many flops can you fit in a data center or something. You have to change the definition around a little bit to keep your eye on the prize. But yeah, this is one of the few phenomena in the world that has held across so many orders of magnitude. It's actually pretty surprising that it is continuing to hold. To me, if you look at fundamental laws of physics, many of them don't hold across 15 orders of magnitude, so it's pretty surprising.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

A good example of this would be that they might sit on a panel for promotion from a certain level to another level in the engineering world, or they might be available to do code review outside of their organization for another organization.

I think that Peter Drucker probably has the best writing on this topic. But as he would describe it, good decisions are made by first understanding all the different points of view and pros and cons to the potential issue at hand or the potential direction, and that great leaders, what they do is they solicit these different points of views. They have a team that they work with to debate and discuss things. So another way to think about this, a king and their court. In an ideal world, if you assume that there's no political motivations, the court is there to advise the king and help them think through different problems and provide different and opposing points of view to allow the king to arrive at the right decision.",

After hearing Chandra walk through this in our conversation, I'm basically going to now point everyone who wants to get better at strategy to this episode and Chandra's method. Strategy is at the heart of every great product and team and business, and it's also the source of so much pain if you do it badly. This episode is meant to help you avoid that. A big thank you to Karthik for making this connection. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Chandra Janakiraman.",

David is the founder of Lexicon Branding, which pioneered the field of brand naming, and invented a few names that you may have heard of including Powerbook, Pentium, Blackberry, Swiffer, the Impossible Burger. Also, Vercel, Windsurf, CapCut, and Azure. In our conversation, David opens up about the very specific process that he and his team go through to find winning names, including a simple exercise that you can do with you and your team to help you find the right name in just a few weeks. We also talk about why a great name is worth spending your time on, why you won't know a great name when you see it, and why you need to feel uncomfortable about the name first. Also, why big team brainstorms don't ever lead to great names. The stories behind names like Pentium, and Sonos, and Vercel, and Windsurf. Also, such interesting insights about the feeling and energy of every letter of the alphabet and so much more.",

So what I think of is high conviction, low consensus bets. So high conviction is, \"We really, really believe this,\" and low consensus is that most other people don't. And there are other people have phrased this differently.

And the biggest mistake, and we used to make this much more than we make now, is, and Amazon has stated this really well, theirs is called disagree and commit. We have a slight twist on, I'll tell you why we twist it a little bit. Ours is debate, decide, unite. That's our kind of phrase that we use in HubSpot culture, but the idea here, the core premise of it is that once you make a decision, getting alignment around that decision, because there will always be at any amount of scale, people that disagree with that decision because they were debating the other side, they would of picked option A and we ended up picking option B.",

Today, it's completely different. Every company is an AI company. We also chat about her take on how she sees AI impacting humanity in the future, how far current technologies will take us, why she's so passionate about building a world model and what exactly world models are, and most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first large world model, Marble, which just came out as this podcast comes out. Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai. It's insane. Definitely check it out.

There's other companies in this space worth billions. It was the type of decision that where I had to practice the professional CEO approach, which is, \"Hey folks, what do you all think?

I said, \"Sorry, this is what we're doing.\" So, I was very dictatorial in that respect.

This is the first in a series of conversations that I'm having with founders who have successfully transformed their established SaaS or marketplace businesses into an AI first company that is growing like crazy and overtaking their decade plus old business. So, many companies and product teams and founders are trying to navigate this very tricky time where every industry is being disrupted by AI, and my goal here is to help you essentially disrupt yourself before somebody else does. The story of Intercom's transformation into Fin is incredible. Their traditional business was valued at billions of dollars, was making hundreds of millions of dollars in ARR, but growth started to plateau and was even about to go negative. Six weeks after GPT-3.5 Came out, they had a working prototype of what is now Fin and Eoghan and the team decided to go all in on AI.",

        "speaker": "(00:15:04):\nAnd I really thought, \"My job is going to be to lead these hordes into battle.\" I really had a martial metaphor. I used it just a second ago, combat of ideas. I was ready for, the old ideas are going to fight us to the death and we're going to win it, and it's not like that at all. We charge onto the field and no other army ever came to charge us back, just we won by default because the people who were doing it the old way didn't really like it or want... It was very few defenders of the old way. There were very few people who came out and said, \"Actually, no, Stage-Gate is actually still the correct product idea. You've got it wrong.\" It never happened, and in fact, the fancy startup people went from dismissing it as totally pointless to complaining that it was overhyped and over before ever passing through the intervening stage of finding out what it was. That was really interesting. I'll never forget, TechCrunch had an article, this is years and years ago about how Lean Startup is overhyped, and I was like, \"You haven't even talked...\" That was the first entry point to talking about it. I was like, \"Could you at least learn to use the word pivot correctly and then criticize it for being overhyped? Is that all possible?\" So, it went from insurgent revival to just the default thing that people did. Even the people that disagree have to carry the meme in order to criticize it. So, it was fascinating to find myself on the other side of this thing, and I would meet young founders coming into the industry for the first time, and they're like, \"It seems obvious,\" and I'm like, \"It was only five years ago that people thought this was so crazy they're yelling at me, now you think it's obvious?\"",

        "speaker": "(00:01:24):\nThis is now my favorite episode of the podcast and I can't wait for you to hear it. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including the current state of the Lean Startup movement, where he sees things heading, what Eric would redo if he could do it over again, misconceptions about the methodology that frustrate him most, how AI will likely impact product development in startups, how to think about MVPs correctly, when to pivot and when to stay the course, also, how to build a business with values that are aligned with human flourishing. Also, tons of amazing stories and lessons, and there's just so much gold in this conversation. And so with that, I bring you Eric Ries, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate, but most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages, and recreating content for other channels and applications, and their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.",

Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and roadmapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds, and it's all built on Jira, where your engineering team is already working, so true collaboration is finally possible.",

And regardless of each individual thing, what was very clear was that the missing piece, the theme that was across all of that is that I hadn't earned their trust. So whether how right or how wrong what I was doing was is the key piece is that I wasn't bringing the team along with me.

And so I started to make pretty fast change and still moving in the direction that was necessary for the org to make the really large impact in how we were operating, but bringing folks along with me.

Today, it's completely different. Every company is an AI company. We also chat about her take on how she sees AI impacting humanity in the future, how far current technologies will take us, why she's so passionate about building a world model and what exactly world models are, and most exciting of all, the launch of the world's first large world model, Marble, which just came out as this podcast comes out. Anyone can go play with this at marble.worldlabs.ai. It's insane. Definitely check it out.

They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch, or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customers' accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product, or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customers' employees. And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all?

Some founders are like, \"I'm going to work on the five that pay us 20 bucks a month, not the five that'll pay us $5,000 a year.\" I find too many folks that don't like sales, too many folks that have not had any life experience in a sales-led environment flee from those customers, and I've never seen that lead to success.

Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus experiments, prove what works. I saw this first hand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong and the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Epo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with Heatmaps and Scrollmaps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags, that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics.

We've tried it or I shouldn't... well, we've experimented in the past with the alternative, so putting it into a business unit and it's just much more problematic and I think the value you get from a central model is far greater than some of the things that you might lose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

We talk about why the best way to stay calm in stressful situations is to focus on the state of your body and not your mind. How to create calm and confidence by changing the state of your body through breath. Jonny shares a bunch of very specific breathing exercises for creating calm and also for creating energy that we actually try out on the podcast. We also get into a bunch of advice for how to tell if you're seeing early signs of burnout, how to release emotional debt that you may be feeling. Also, why feeling the feels gives you a competitive advantage in business. Also, a practice called APE, which reminds you to focus on your awareness, your posture, and your emotions that have started practicing ever since our chat and so much more.

I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.\n\nLenny",

You're probably losing sales because people are waiting for a feature and you're not ready to launch it yet. You want to make it better.

We have, as I've mentioned, we are constantly looking at our processes and trying to figure out how we can make them better and better as an organization, as we've grown, things need to adjust. We today are doing it quarterly. The quarterly aspect of walking the stores by no means meant to be like that's the only time people do it. But that is the time where we're looking for update your scorecard and share the information in a dashboard where everybody can see. That is feeling right now to be the right cadence because that's enough time that there can be material differences made. You can see the scores evolve over time. But also frequently enough that you're not missing that perhaps there's been a setback since. But, of course, my real hope is that they're happening weekly, just perhaps in different parts of the organization.\n\nLenny",

        "speaker": "(00:20:47):\nSo yeah, the bar is there. And like I said, there's clearly some in that remaining, let's call it 90%, that are good. And then, there's a lot that are just not that great and there's some that are bad. And if you write one of these ones that are bad which bad being defined as people who normally disagree find the note not helpful, so it's like the inverse of the ones we show. If you write one that people normally disagree, find not helpful, you actually will ultimately lose your ability to write and have to earn it back. That other 90% is a mix. Sometimes people look at the number, they're like, \"Oh, why don't you show more?\" It's like, \"Well, you probably actually don't really want us showing most of those.\" The gold here is that the system is able to filter out the good ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

We get into the surprising origin story of the product, how the algorithm actually works, how the algorithm emerged out of an internal contest within Twitter, the principles behind Community Notes, and why staying true to them has been so key to its success. Also, how it survived four different leaders, including Elon and Jack, and why it's now a big part of the solution to solving misinformation on the internet.

        "speaker": "(00:04:56):\nI find that there's generally two reasons why a grow team wants to experiment, and one of them is to understand more precisely the metric impact of what they're building and what they're putting in front of customers, and the other is risk mitigation where you're making so many big dramatic changes that there's some risk that while this could be really great for the business, it could also be really bad and it would be good to understand that before everybody's experiencing that in production. So, with that framework in mind, sometimes you don't need to experiment. Sometimes if the business, let's say activation, right, activation rates go up 6% versus 7%, that precision actually doesn't help all that much beyond being able to say in your performance review, \"Hey, I increased activation by 7%.\" So, it also is expensive to have folks on the ground, be it engineers, analysts, product managers, spending time understanding the results of an experiment that could otherwise be spent on road mapping, on foundational analysis, on shipping things.

Why every good story is centered around one five-second moment of transformation and so much more. Matt is an incredible human being and I am excited to spread his message more widely. If you're interested in this topic, definitely pick up his book, Storyworthy. It'll change your life. With that, I bring you Matthew Dicks, after a short word from our sponsors.",

I think we could spend a lot of time talking about it, but the truly interesting thing, the first one is, you can't do this by having a traditional log structure. CZ, the founder and CEO at one point had 55 direct reports, and his direct reports had about the similar ones. For a large portion of the history of the company, there was just one level between the individual employees and the CEO. That leads to an extreme level of decision-making and execution.

It's so much easier to use and it makes my work so much more enjoyable.\" This is the reason because we have not taken a single step in this direction.

Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I left most was our experimentation platform where could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insight with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing.

I think sometimes just having a conversation or a big meeting where people are talking, I'm just not very auditory, I'm a very visual person, it's hard for me to follow along just by listening. I will often have a visual in a meeting. I will leverage that visual to literally real time edit what is being decided. For example, if we have multiple options, I will edit the slide that's being projected to say, \"We decided on option one, here are the next steps, 1, 2, 3.\" A lot of times people are saying, \"That's not what I heard. I heard this as a next step, or I heard that as a next step.\" I love that because that avoids leaving the meeting and being like, \"I don't know what we agreed to. I heard this, you heard that.\" No, actually we haven't agreed upon set of decisions and next steps that we all real time edited and looked at together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

And it's basically like the earth is kind of living and breathing and can respond to threats. Okay? And when you enter the rainforest too deep, Ebola virus will be released. Okay? So I think the internet operates on a similar paradigm here where if you do the wrong thing by users, the internet will come back and get even and defend itself. And so whenever I design products, I try to do right by users because it'll always come back much worse and I think you should always operate above board with how you design your growth systems. And with Gas, we had to do things the right way and we had to figure out at each particular moment or problem that we solve, will it spread within schools? Will it hop schools? Will people pay for it? All of these things was a whole reinvention of the original product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

So, where do we begin? Maybe the best place to start is by first, before we dive into the tactics around how do we become indistractable, the first place to start is what is distraction? Understanding the term really, really matters. And the best way to understand what distraction is, is to understand what distraction is not. What's the opposite of distraction?

Why would it be so incredibly rude to just walk into someone's home and light up a cigarette? Well, because there wasn't a law that said that that was illegal, someone's private residence. What changed was that we have new norms, new manners around how to behave when it comes to these destructive behaviors. So, I remember when my mom took away those ashtrays in our living room and she threw them away, and one day, one of her friends came over and took out a pact of cigarettes and was about to light a cigarette.

Usually, I have talking points, and things get mixed around, and it's informal. This was media trained, \"Do not say the wrong thing.\" Kind of talk. And I just could not remember what to say. I had some version of a panic attack, walked off-stage, I was still mic'd up, cursed. Everyone started laughing. I was like, \"Geez, are they laughing at me? Oh my God, this is...\"",

Mainly, it was the book that I wish I had, rather than having to learn by a narrative from the first round capital portfolio and what have you. And then subsequent to that, I started what became the nation's largest sales operations and leadership community, it's called Modern Sales Pros. It's 30,000 sales operations, sales leaders, et cetera. And then started a new software company called Atrium that makes data-driven sales management software, and then here I am.

So, very similar to how back in the day, you do product analytics by licking your fingers and sticking it in the wind, and then Mixpanels showed up, then Amplitude showed up, then so on and so forth, and the same is the case in sales, as well. So, modern sales is a more thoughtful, operational, rigorous, analytical bent, it's been around for a while. It's one of those things, the future is here, it just wasn't widely distributed, but now it's being much more distributed and much more embraced. Like the pre-Moneyball moment in sports and baseball to the post-Moneyball moment, we're now just flipping over there, so that's the delta.\n\nLenny",

So you apply, you get matched, and then you go through an orientation program that we run live where we tell you how this works and what to expect in your first meeting. And then there's a whole set of agendas and materials and everything in the book as well as everyone gets a free workbook, a 100-page workbook after they join the community with all of the templates and guides and questions. And then the moderator pulls you together, you work on Zoom or whatever technology, it's remote typically. And you do a first meeting, we call it meeting zero, where you're open and vulnerable. People share stories about their lives and who they are, builds trust and get a sense of who people are. And then you move into the process. You meet twice a week typically if you're in a fast seeker council and every two weeks if you're in a slow seeker. So that's the start of the answer. Does that help you think?\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

Also, how to actually lay out a strategy, why organizational dynamics are often the biggest hindrance to winning strategies and so much more.

This is a problem of today, and the only reason we haven't seen massive hacks or serious damage from AI tools so far is because they haven't been given enough power yet, and they aren't that widely adopted yet. But with the rise of agents who can take actions on your behalf and AI-powered browsers and student robots, the risk is going to increase very quickly. This conversation isn't meant to slow down progress on AI or to scare you. In fact, it's the opposite. The appeal here is for people to understand the risks more deeply and to think harder about how we can better mitigate these risks going forward. At the end of the conversation, Sander shares some concrete suggestions for what you can do in the meantime, but even those will only take us so far. I hope this sparks a conversation about what possible solutions might look like and who is best fit to tackle them.",

Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX friction and business impact. It starts with product analytics, where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention, and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus, experiments prove what works. I saw this firsthand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong.

It turns out even taking notes, taking notes synthesizing them, and then sharing them can actually be an L task, an N task or an O task, depending on what type of notes they are. So, after I understood this, previously, I would just send all notes. I tried to make them really good, which took a lot of time. But then I realized, well, this is a meeting where, yes, I need to send notes, but again, it's like, it's just standard stuff, I just need to quickly list out. People need to really know is the three action items that came out of the meetings who owns them, that's it.",

That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercell, Webflow and Loom.

Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS, it's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free.

Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?\" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, \"Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative.\" And then I'll say, \"But most of your engineers are working on this migration.\" And they'll say, \"Yeah, we have to finish that.\" I'm like, \"So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?\" It's like, \"Yeah.\"",

For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product. The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions, providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful.",

Or what we did was we actually went down a different path and the path that we went down was we basically synchronized the movement of the board. Let's say Lenny's presenting a board, some template he's created in terms of best practices for PMs, but he wants to have some sort of a talk track on top of it, an audio video feed. What we are doing is we're actually capturing the movement of the board that Lenny's going through along with the video talk track that's on top.

The mistake that I see a lot of product managers make is they start operating in either output or outcomes. And when you are transitioning to outcomes, it's very important that you continue to still hone your craft on outputs. For instance, do you just give up on the go-to-market strategy or do you start making product nodes which are then picked up by marketing people and are able to be used to create that go-to-market strategy? You always, always have to have the output and outcome even when you're moving up the so-called career management ladder. So that is very, very critical that as you are producing, even when you are at the senior most levels, don't forget your IC roots, don't forget the IC component. And sometimes it is necessary to just pull up your sleeves and go back and keep working on those things. That also gives you a lot of creds with others in the team as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",
