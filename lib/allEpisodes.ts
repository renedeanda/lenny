    "description": "Aishwarya Naresh Reganti and Kiriti Badam have helped build and launch more than 50 enterprise AI products across companies like OpenAI, Google, Amazon, and Databricks. Based on these experiences, they’ve developed a small set of best practices for building and scaling successful AI products. The goal of this conversation is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering.\n\n*We discuss:*\n1. Two key ways AI products differ from traditional software, and why that fundamentally changes how they should be built\n2. Common patterns and anti-patterns in companies that build strong AI products versus those that struggle\n3. A framework they developed from real-world experience to iteratively build AI products that create a flywheel of improvement\n4. Why obsessing about customer trust and reliability is an underrated driver of successful AI products\n5. Why evals aren’t a cure-all, and the most common misconceptions people have about them\n6. The skills that matter most for builders in the AI era\n\n*Get 15% off Aishwarya and Kiriti’s Maven course, Building Agentic AI Applications with a Problem-First Approach, using this link:* https://bit.ly/3V5XJFp\n\n*Brought to you by:*\nMerge—The fastest way to ship 220+ integrations: https://merge.dev/lenny\nStrella—The AI-powered customer research platform: https://strella.io/lenny\nBrex—The banking solution for startups: https://www.brex.com/product/business-account?ref_code=bmk_dp_brand1H25_ln_new_fs\n\n*Episode transcript:* https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-openai-and-google-engineers-learned\n*Archive of all Lenny's Podcast transcripts:* https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/yxi4s2w998p1gvtpu4193/AMdNPR8AOw0lMklwtnC0TrQ?rlkey=j06x0nipoti519e0xgm23zsn9&st=4jmgl11w&dl=0\n\n*My biggest takeaways (for paid newsletter subscribers):* https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/i/183007822/referenced\n\n*Where to find Aishwarya Naresh Reganti:*\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/areganti\n• GitHub: https://github.com/aishwaryanr/awesome-generative-ai-guide\n• X: https://x.com/aish_reganti\n\n*Where to find Kiriti Badam:*\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-kiriti-badam\n• X: https://x.com/kiritibadam\n\n*Where to find Lenny:*\n• Newsletter: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com\n• X: https://twitter.com/lennysan\n• LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lennyrachitsky/\n\n*In this episode, we cover:*\n(00:00) Introduction to Aishwarya and Kiriti\n(05:03) Challenges in AI product development\n(07:36) Key differences between AI and traditional software\n(13:19) Building AI products: start small and scale\n(15:23) The importance of human control in AI systems\n(22:38) Avoiding prompt injection and jailbreaking\n(25:18) Patterns for successful AI product development\n(33:20) The debate on evals and production monitoring\n(41:27) Codex team’s approach to evals and customer feedback\n(45:41) Continuous calibration, continuous development (CC/CD) framework\n(58:07) Emerging patterns and calibration\n(01:01:24) Overhyped and under-hyped AI concepts\n(01:05:17) The future of AI\n(01:08:41) Skills and best practices for building AI products\n(01:14:04) Lightning round and final thoughts\n\n*Referenced:*\n• LevelUp Labs: https://levelup-labs.ai/\n• Why your AI product needs a different development lifecycle: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-your-ai-product-needs-a-different\n• Booking.com: https://www.booking.com\n• Research paper on agents in production (by Matei Zaharia’s lab): https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04123\n• Matei Zaharia’s research on Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I1EvjZsAAAAJ&hl=en\n• The coming AI security crisis (and what to do about it) | Sander Schulhoff: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-coming-ai-security-crisis\n• Gajen Kandiah on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gajenkandiah\n• Rackspace: https://www.rackspace.com\n• The AI-native startup: 5 products, 7-figure revenue, 100% AI-written code | Dan Shipper (co-founder/CEO of Every): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/inside-every-dan-shipper\n• Semantic Diffusion: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html\n• LMArena: https://lmarena.ai\n• Artificial Analysis: https://artificialanalysis.ai/leaderboards/providers\n• Why humans are AI’s biggest bottleneck (and what’s coming in 2026) | Alexander Embiricos (OpenAI Codex Product Lead): https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/why-humans-are-ais-biggest-bottleneck\n• Airline held liable for its chatbot giving passenger bad advice—what this means for travellers: https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240222-air-canada-chatbot-misinformation-what-travellers-should-know\n• Demis Hassabis on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/demishassabis\n...References continued at: https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/what-openai-and-google-engineers-learned\n\n_Production and marketing by https://penname.co/._\n_For inquiries about sponsoring the podcast, email podcast@lennyrachitsky.com._\n\nLenny may be an investor in the companies discussed.",

And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it.",

What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time."

But just to kind of mirror back what you're describing, this idea of start with high control, low agency, the example you gave is the support agents just kind of giving suggestions, is not able to do anything, the user is in charge. And then as that becomes useful and you are confident it's doing the right sort of work, you give it a little more agency and you kind of pull back on the control the user has. And then if that's starting to go well, then you give it more agency and the user needs less control to control it. Awesome."

        "speaker": "So let me give you a few more examples of this kind of progression that you recommend. And the reason I'm spending so much time here is this is a really key part of your recommendation to help people build more successful AI products. This idea of start slow with high control and low agency and then build up over time once you've built confidence that it's doing the right sort of work. So a few more examples that you shared in your post that I'll just read. So say you're building a coding assistant, V1 would be just suggest inline completion and boilerplate snippets. V2 would be generate larger blocks like tests or refactors for humans to review. And then V3 is just apply the changes and open PRs autonomously. And then another example is a marketing assistant. So V1 would be draft emails or social copy, just like here's what I would do.",

        "text": "V2 is build a multi-step campaign and run the campaign. And V3 is just launch it A/B tested auto-optimize campaigns across channels. Awesome. Yeah. And again, just to summarize where we're at, just to give people the advice we've shared so far. One is just important to understand AI products are different. They're non-deterministic. And you pointed out, and I forgot to actually mirror back this point, both on the input and the output. The user experience is non-deterministic.People will see different things, different outputs, different chat conversations, different maybe UI if it's designing the UI for you. And also the output obviously is going to be non-terministic. So that's a problem and a challenge. And then-"

So the bar to using AI products is much lower because you can be as natural as you would be with humans, but that's also the problem, which is there are tons of ways we communicate and you want to make sure that that intent is rightly communicated and the right actions are taken because most of your systems are deterministic and you want to achieve a deterministic outcome, but with non-deterministic technology and that's where it gets a little messy."

And I basically helped them for the first two years of its existence or its sort of like first full existence. And philanthropy sounds calm. You know what I mean? We're like, oh, giving money away. Must be so peaceful over there. And CZI grew from, I think the week I joined, it was 30 people and we bought two companies that week and it grew to 250 people that year.

And really the other piece that I find truly fascinating is what genuinely makes the difference between a business that grows but then plateaus versus these generational businesses. The ones that go on forever. Sort of the difference between a Twitter or MySpace and a Facebook. Billions in revenue versus hundreds of billions in revenue. So what I like to do is take my experience and use it to help other leaders. I want to give people tools that work. And I also want to be honest about how hard all of this stuff really is."

You have to get really resilient to just making mistakes all the time. And you know that the way of learning is through those mistakes.

You wrote about him in your book as a great exemplar of great culture in the prison gang that he ran. So interesting. But something that he learned from you that he told me I need to ask you about is about success and how to be successful and how it's not what people think.

And in flying, that can't ever be the priority because there are conditions, there are things that happen. And then the second one was, \"Well, his timing of when the sun would go down was wrong.\" So he thought he'd be flying in sunlight and he wasn't. And then once he got up there, it was when the plane was going down making it go up was a bad decision because he was upside down. And so it was like, I can't remember all the things, but this guy had 17 bad decisions in a row. And the big thing for me that I felt was really true is it's one decision leads to another. And so if you can break psychologically, you can take the sunk cost, then that gets you out of a lot of bad paths. And then a little good decision may be difficult, but you have to believe it's going to lead to the next one. And a lot of success is about that. It's a small thing, a small thing that's hard to do that doesn't seem to have a high impact, but it leads to the next small hard to do thing and then eventually you get an outcome, so that was kind of the concept."

Everyone wanted to look at the top of their house when the imagery came out. And it was really interesting because there's so many subtle product lessons in there. First is, I think as you have these new technologies, rather than literally digitizing what came before, if you can create an entirely new experience, it answers the question for a new customer, why should I give this the time of day? And so, really disassembling the Lego set and reassembling into something new rather than just digitizing what was there before. Certainly, that was the lesson I think in Google Maps, really was native to the platform in a way that a paper map couldn't be and that was a really meaningful breakthrough.",

We were on Saturday Night Live, which is the coolest thing. Andy Samberg in, I think it was called Lazy Sunday rapped about Google Maps and Lars and I were texting each other. We did it. We're on Saturday Live. Mission accomplished. And it was also showing that as you're there thinking about products, there's the why you decide to use a product and then what is the enduring value.

It may not get rid of customer service, for example, but it may allow 10 people in the Midwest, who would normally be working at a call center, to serve hundreds of thousands or millions of people. Maybe that's too much, but a lot more people than they would ordinarily if they were the ones on the phone all the time.",

And I think the people in the US are going to be better, in a lot of cases, at using these AI tools to do work. So I think it may actually make it more effective to have those jobs in the US run by people sitting in the US who are using it to get work done. And also, the model companies are here too. So there's a lot of American stuff happening, and you can decide whether or not you think that's a good thing, but I think it's quite lost in the conversation over whether AI will get rid of jobs."

When I heard that and when I've reflected on it, that is the longest lasting thing. I remember there was also a story that Steve was talking to, I think it was either Ed Catmull or John Lasseter at Pixar, and he said, \"Everything we make is going to be a doorstop in three years, but the stuff you guys make, they're still going to be watching in 100 years.\" So I think Steve had some concept of the longevity of these things.",

I mean everything from the checkout system when you go to the receptionist to what it's like in the cafeteria. At least when I was there, they had patented the pizza box because they had reinvented the pizza box that you would get at Cafe Max because the whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better?

Then when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well. And so I think Hiroki gave himself time to do that and I think that's probably a lot of why he's been so successful at Airbnb.

Open mics are the real live experiments. You put something out there, you get very clear micro feedback from users, and then you get tough feedback sometimes. And I think as product builders, that's actually one of the great skills to have, which is you sometimes launch stuff that have a fantastic vision, but the first version is not quite there.

And so part of it's being able to understand the rest of that context that would drive somebody to say, \"Why would somebody cut their arm off?\" Well, if they're in this situation and this and this and this, there's nobody who would say they want to cut their arm off, but in certain situations you'll do it. And so that's what we're trying to do is find, where will people change behavior?"

        "speaker": "A simple example is think of Snickers and Milky Way, right? They're both candy bars, they're both bought in the checkout aisle, they're both made almost with the same ingredients, one has peanuts, one doesn't. And if you start to compare the products and do a competitive benchmark, you start to get to one's a little softer, one's a little harder, one's got a few more calories, one's got less calories. But when you talk to people about when's the last time they ate a Snickers, when time's the last time they ate a Milky Way, you start to realize that Snickers typically is a case where they missed the last meal, they've got a lot of work to do, they're running out of energy and they want to basically get back to the tasks as fast as possible. And so you start to realize that Snickers is about almost like a meal replacement and it's about the stomach is growling and things like that. And you start to realize that if they didn't have a Snickers, it competes with a protein drink, it competes with a Red Bull, a coffee.",

It's usually eaten alone, and it's taking time to regroup after this emotional thing. And you start to realize that it competes with things like a glass of wine, a brownie, and to be honest, a run. And so when you start to realize that, jobs helps you see the true competitive set from what we call the demand side of the world as opposed to the competitive set from the supply side of the world, which is the technology or the underlying business model by how which we're making it. And so it allows you to actually see what customers really want as opposed to trying to figure out, how do we sell things to people?"

        "speaker": "And when we went to study them, we realized that they actually had a very different job than a typical 18 to 24 year old because one, they were a little bit older, typically they had either already had a degree or they basically had tried to go to college and it didn't work. And it was about basically time now that they had responsibility to do something new. And so they didn't actually build the product at all. And as they started to look and say how many people want to go back to school but can't? They started to realize it's not a thousand people, it's not 10,000 people, they have over 200,000 students. They're one of the largest universities in the world. And so all of this starts with a struggling moment, not with a product.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:06",
        "text": "And so that's what we mean when we're customer-centric is that we're studying the struggling moments they have and people like Intercom and Basecamp, they look at struggling moments and that becomes their roadmap. Because again, think about a roadmap. I'm literally trying to tell you what I'm going to build in the next 24 months, for example, but none of us saw ChatGPT coming. And so all of a sudden I have to go undo the roadmap. But if I talk about the struggling moments that I'm trying to go after, all of a sudden I realize that the roadmap is now when I get to that struggling moment, there's multiple ways I can solve it. So instead of just talking about features, it's typically talking about features for the first 90 to 120 days, but after that we just talk about struggling moments because that's the seed for real innovation and basically where new products come from."
      },

        "speaker": "But it's not just the pain. See, what we're taught in business school was pain and gain, but the reality is it's the context. It's the fact that I didn't eat lunch before, the fact that I still have a lot of work to do, the fact that I have this podcast going on. It's not that I'm in pain, but it's the context that makes me value this in the moment that much more than something else. And so part of this is it's not just about pain and gain, it's about context and outcomes.",
        "timestamp": "00:10:34",
        "text": "And so when you frame it that way, it becomes a vector, a vector of progress or a vector of intention of what they're trying to do. And once we frame that, then we can actually wrap technology around it. And the crazy part is that I was always told or taught if I build the best product, it will sell better. And what I've learned is that actually a kick-ass half is better than a half-ass hole, and that's what Jason talks about. But the reality is like if you look at QuickBooks, QuickBooks has half the features and double the price. And you start to realize that at some point in time it's about meeting customers where they are, not trying to wow them and not trying to convince them. They convince themselves to make the progress."

It had the sort of home experience where everything was incredibly personalized for the individuals, and there were several motivational elements built into the whole product experience. And it was very transformational for the company and the product because it changed the product from being a meditation app to a broader health and wellness service and really put the company on a different trajectory.

And it was almost as if there was a strategy gene that you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot, and I sort of wanted to ask myself, is it possible to break that divide between the haves and the have-nots and make this capability widely accessible through a procedural approach.

So imagine, this is sort of how sometimes strategy reviews go, which is you bring a fruit to the reviewer and say, \"Hey, here's a mango, what do you think?\" And the reviewer says, \"I actually don't like mangoes.\" And you're like, \"Oh,\" you're sort of sad. You take it back, you bring an apple and you show, \"Hey, what do you think of an apple?\" And then the leader says, \"I actually stopped eating apples last year.\" And so you're disappointed again. You go back, you bring a banana. \"I hated bananas since I was a kid.\" And so it's a bit of a silly caricature of reviews, but there's a bit of grain of truth there, which is, imagine how frustrating that is for both the reviewer and the person who's reviewing.",
        "timestamp": "00:22:54",
        "text": "And so it could be made so much better if you just engage with your leaders before you actually build a strategy. It's amazing how few people actually do that. And so the fruit story tells you, hey, imagine if you just asked the reviewer, \"Do you even like fruits?\" How much better the experience would've been for both parties. And so leadership interviews are a very important part of a strategy formulation process. So you can divide and conquer, there's several leaders, like you assign different leaders to different people on the strategy working group and each of them sort talks to that leader. And there are a few questions that I would recommend asking, and it's basically, what does success feel like for the leader? What does failure look like? What is the measure of success? What are principles to keep in mind while going through this process?"

One of the reasons for the difficulty is that it is very fragmented, so you would need to download what's called an IDE. It's basically a code editor. You need to download the runtime, basically Python or JavaScript, need to figure out a package manager to configure your kind of open source packages, and once you've done all of that, you need to figure out how to deploy it, how to share it. So it's a very hard process, and that's one of the ways where people get stuck and never learn how to code because it just feels like this cumbersome IT process.",
        "timestamp": "00:03:42",

It's easier to learn. So that's the product today. It is I think one of the more easier IDEs/ environment/deployment environment on the internet, and I think we make it really easy for people to just jump in even without prior experience of coding, especially now with the new AI products that we built."

I know this guy from Canada, he's awesome, tweeted about how his 11-year-old girl built an app in Replit. She just had an idea and she built it. And the best part of it is someone in the... replied to him and they're like, \"You have to launch an app. You have to host it somewhere. You have to build a database. You have to deploy it. There's no way to do that.\" And he's like, \"No, that's exactly what Replit did.\""

So we're going to jump into a demo of what this actually looks like. I thought maybe actually before we get into it, there's other tools that people are aware of that help you build stuff. And so to put a finer point on what this does and how it's different from other things, you may have heard of, say, Cursor, it comes up a lot these days, just talk about a little bit about the competitive landscape of who else is out there that helps you build product."

      {
        "speaker": "Again, we go back to this idea of end-to-end platform for making software. So that's from writing code all the way to deploying it, and monetizing it and all of that. Now, every step in the process of the software development lifecycle, there are a lot of different tools. So Cursor is a fork of VS Code that's made that has really awesome AI tools, but that's an editor. You still need runtime, you still need a deployment environment. Actually, quite a few users use Cursor in tandem with Replit, because Replit just simplifies the runtime and deployment environment.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:42",
        "text": "And so you have products, AI products, different places in the software development lifecycle, but really what differentiates Replit is that we do everything, but also that makes it harder to adopt for certain people. If you're at a big company, it's very easy to bring a new editor and start coding with it. It's quite hard to bring something that's quite opinionated about everything from how the code runs to how the code deploys, but that's the trade-off we're willing to make is like yeah, we're not going to get into the enterprise main software development pipeline, but we want to empower everyone to be able to build software, and that means product managers, designers. We have operations people, sales ops, HR ops. We have lawyers using Replit, and so it is democratizing the act of software engineering."

My one mindset that I really have leaned into after someone actually gave me advice on this is to figure out how to have fun in my job, even in the most difficult of times. The reason why I say that is because when you're hit with really hard times, it's easy to operate from a mindset of scarcity and to look at everything as an unachievable hurdle to overcome. And when I was able to switch my mindset and say, \"Well, I'm actually going to figure out a way to have fun with this,\" it actually changed my entire for how to deal with super difficult situations.",

It was a super daunting situation. I didn't know how I was going to manage and at first I felt so scared by what was ahead of me and how much change I was going to have to go through in a very short period of time. But when I got this advice, I started to try to reframe my thinking and it actually really made it so that I was able to get through that hard time and opened my mind up to so many more opportunities. So, now I try to embody that in every situation that I come across where I'm faced with something super, super challenging."

I'm going to have so much fun doing this. It's going to be like this energy and anxiety I'm feeling is me feeling like it's going to be a lot of fun.\" So, spending a little more time here, how do you actually do this? So in this case, you shared an example of basically you have to fire a bunch of people, not something one can quickly think about how to have fun with that. How did you do this? Is it just in your mind you're like, \"I'm going to have fun with this,\" or is there something tactically people can do to make something fun?"

What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome even though it is incredibly challenging to be facing it right now? So that's one thing that I've done. The second thing I think that has been really helpful is in going into meetings or other situations where I was trying to figure out how to collectively solve some big challenge, figuring out how to bring humor into the meeting. Just starting it on a light note and that elevated my own mood and way I was approaching the meeting, but also adds a level of levity to the situation for other people as well, which I think as a leader is super important because it's not just about your own mindset, but how are you transferring that mindset to the people that you're working with and the people that are working for you."

They're super excited to launch a marketplace, we all are, and they want to talk about supply and demand, they want to look at all kinds of ratios. They show me economic papers and ask, \"How could we apply this principle to my company?\" And here, my advice is generally always, \"If you don't have product market fit, and if you don't have a good enough growth strategy for at least one side of your marketplace, just forget about all this marketplace stuff.\"",

But my take is I'm a huge believer in market forces and empowerment, so provide guardrails for what a good experience is in your marketplace, set a clear bar for quality, and provide the right coaching and tools for supply to be successful, and then take a step back and see where the gaps are and invest more in hands-on tactics just to close those gaps more specifically."

And I think on paper what makes a marketplace is pretty straightforward, it's two or more sides that are distinct from one another, and they provide value to each other, and then you have an intermediary trying to facilitate that exchange of value in the middle. So, that's pretty simple explanation. I think in practice it's always a little bit more nuanced on the fringes. You have all those interesting dimensions, like how involved is the intermediary defines how managed the marketplace is. So, something like Craigslist is super hands-off, unmanaged, and something like Lyft starts to be more into the semi-managed where the platform significantly shapes the transaction in this exchange of value. So, I think that's how I see it, but there's all those fascinating variations of marketplaces, I guess."

They get these offers and then they say, \"Well, of course I'm not going to leave because my best case scenario at Meta is that we make money and my best case at Anthropic is we affect the future of humanity and try to make AI flourish and human flourishing go well.\" To me, it's not a hard choice. Other people have different life circumstances and it makes it a much harder decision for them. For anybody who does get those mega offers and accepts them, I can't say I hold it against them when they accept it, but it's definitely not something that I would want to take myself if it came to me."

And so to pay individuals like $100 million over four year package, that's actually pretty cheap compared to the value created for the business. I think we're just in an unprecedented era of scale and it's only going to get crazier actually. If you extrapolate the exponential on how much companies are spending, it's like 2X a year roughly in terms of CapEx, and today we're maybe in the globally $300 billion range, the entire industry spending on this, and so numbers like 100 million are a drop in the bucket.

I think progress has actually been accelerating where if you look at the cadence of model releases, it used to be once a year and now with the improvements in our post-training techniques, we're seeing releases every month or three months, and so I would say progress is actually accelerating in many ways, but there's this weird time compression effect. Dario compared it to being in a near light speed journey where a day that passes for you is like five days back on earth and we're accelerating. The time dilation is increasing.",

We did kind of need this transition from normal pre-training to reinforcement learning scaling up to continue the scaling laws, but I think it's kind of like for semiconductors where it's less about the density of transistors that you can fit on a chip and more about how many flops can you fit in a data center or something. You have to change the definition around a little bit to keep your eye on the prize. But yeah, this is one of the few phenomena in the world that has held across so many orders of magnitude. It's actually pretty surprising that it is continuing to hold. To me, if you look at fundamental laws of physics, many of them don't hold across 15 orders of magnitude, so it's pretty surprising."

Just my experience is there are plenty of engineers who actually think they can be product managers and they don't really understand all of the elements of the product job that they would need to be successful.

I think it's really rare that people, one, see a company scale to the heights of Uber and Opendoor with such a heavy operational component that are still tech companies and also it's really where someone starts an ops and then moves into product and ends up where you are, where your chief product officer, really successful company. So I have a bunch of questions here. Maybe the first is just what has having been in ops done to make you a better product leader? How does that change the way that you operate as a product leader?"

You worked with a ton of amazing startups as an advisor, including Twitter, you're now Director of Product Management at YouTube. This is a career that many people would dream of having.

I felt like I was kind of stuck. I felt like I was working harder but not seeing incremental benefit to the work that I was doing. And I knew that I needed a change, but emotionally I understood that, but I couldn't really have an objective way of thinking about it. And so I really pushed myself to figure out what is actually going on with my situation and how do I create a way that I can rely on objectively to understand what's actually going on? And so I looked at that situation and I wrote that post and the framework is really that there's impact that you're really trying to drive and that is the thing that is the most important. And the impact is only achievable by looking at two sets of variables, a set of variables related to the environment, a set of variables related to your skills, and really breaking down each and understanding what's happening in the environment bit by bit and what's happening with your skills and where are you hindered structurally within the environment? Where are your skills kind of lacking and what do you have control over? And using that whole kind of output, that framework to decide what makes the most sense."

That is actually a form of impact. Just creating the clarity that people need to understand and believe in the investment. The reason why I name this and it feels a little counterintuitive is that the more senior you get, the more there are questions of are we even investing in the right place, right? Is this area, is this team, is this org the right investment? And so being able to even create the clarity that there is opportunity, it is the right thing to do, it is strategically and structurally important, is a form of impact. And then actually delivering on that impact, showing that you can make progress quickly, that you can deliver fast lane wins as Casey Winters would say, or medium and slow wins and then actually showing that you can do this again and again is how you actually validate the impact that you can see where the opportunity is and what's going on."

The more money you have, the more happy you tend to be.\" Okay, so this is a classic example where people will tear each other down sometimes and that guy's wrong and whatever. And instead, it was Kahneman's like, \"All right, let's do it together.\" And they joined forces along with Barb Mellers to basically try to resolve that issue.

The first is this, there's all sorts of parenting books, there's all sorts of styles. A book needs to sell, so they need to sell you something new or different or whatever, okay. But the only thing that matters really is that your kids know you love them, really know deep in their bones, know you love them.",

Do you homeschool? Do you send them to private school? Do you send them [inaudible 00:10:49]? We can have lots of [inaudible 00:10:51], but it all dwarfs in comparison to your children know that you would lay down in the street in the front of a bus if it meant that they would be alive and happy. That's the number one thing I say. Number two is at some point, you will drop your baby on its head. So I bet this has happened to you already."

        "speaker": "So here's the thing about babies, is babies can't move. And so you get very used to as a mom or a dad or you're sitting on the couch and you're folding laundry and your baby is right here next to you and your baby can't move. And then one day without warning, your baby can roll over. And you think it's fine because you put a pillow there or something, but you turn your back for a second because you're like whatever and then your baby falls on its head. It happened with every single one of my children. And they don't fall that far and whatever, but they're totally fine and you're not a bad parent. And it's just this, there are things you don't know and stuff's going to happen and it's not going to be perfect. And every little thing isn't going to have some lasting impression on your child because at some point, you will drop your baby on its head and you will not mean to, you didn't intend to.",

        "text": "But in my case, it was always like, oh my gosh, my baby can roll over. I did not think that was going to happen today. And gosh, by the time I got to the fourth one, it's like I'm chasing after one baby to try to get the diaper on and this and that, so then the other baby hits its head. So I think there's just a lesson in that which is like it's a small thing, don't sweat it and don't get mad at yourself because you made a mistake. It's like the mistake would be, oh, I realize my baby could roll over now. So now you should make sure that you're taking extra precautions about your baby rolling over off the couch. But it's really just a funny way for me to say your baby's going to hit its head or walk into a coffee table or get cut or whatever. It's like they're very resilient and you didn't do anything wrong as a parent, so don't beat yourself up about that. And then I do actually have one other thing I say."

What you can do as a parent is make sure they say please and thank you. So what I find with parents of one is particularly if that one is very well-behaved, they think they're a great parent and they may be. That would be resulting. They may be, but once you have four, what you realize is like, oh, my parenting really didn't have anything to do with it. But my children do say please and thank you."

Check out this new feature, and these Pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them.",

This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan.

        "speaker": "I think that most people experience a richer, fuller, more meaningful life when they have at least some high quality relationships or maybe put the other way. If you have none, it's unlikely you're going to experience quite as rich and full a life. So I often talk about relationships exist on a continuum. At one end of the continuum is contact and no connection, or we could also say dysfunction. And by the way, contact no connection. Those are thousands of Facebook friends. Those are not relationships and those are not friends in my vocabulary. At the other end of the continuum is what my co-author David Bradford and I came to call exceptional, and exceptional relationships have a particular set of characteristics that I can get into if you want to. But before I even do that, we're not suggesting, and I'm not suggesting that everybody needs to turn every one of their relationships into something exceptional.",

        "text": "That would be, first of all, impractical, second of all, unnecessary. But it turns out that the skills you need to move along that continuum actually take you from contact and no connection and dysfunction to at least functional and robust. And then once you've acquired those skills, then you can decide whether or not you want to take a few of those relationships a lot farther, take them all the way to exceptional, but at least you've gained what you need to know in order to get to functional and robust. And I believe if we had a critical mass of human beings on this planet who had those skills and knew how to get to at least robust and functional, we wouldn't just have more functional teams and organizations, we'd have stronger communities, we'd have more functional schools. We might, in my wildest dreams, even have a more functional government. And so that's my life's mission."

People learn how to be more interpersonally competent or how to connect with other people in more functional ways. And what I mean by connect is learn how I need to show up in order for you to trust me, in order for you to feel closer to me, in order for you to want to spend more time with me in a leadership. By the way, this is part of the leadership curriculum I taught, in a leadership sense that makes you more likely to want to follow me because in the end, that's the question leaders should ask themselves, \"Why should somebody follow me?\" And you know what? You could study other leaders. Why did somebody follow Steve Jobs? Why did somebody follow Ursula at Xerox? Why did some people follow Sheryl Sandberg or why should somebody follow me? Because I'm not any of those people. So the question I ask my students to sit in and now my Leaders in Tech participants to sit in is why should somebody follow you?",

They think they may make a lot of money if they hitch their wagon to you. Those are all good reasons. But if you want to build a sustainable long-term legacy, then you probably want to think about showing up in a way that other people come to see you as a referent figure, somebody in their life that they say, \"When I grow up, I want to be more like that.\" And that is a form of power. There's a lot of research that supports this, referent power. You're a referent figure, and then people are much likely to be open to your influence, and open to working harder, and open to doing some of the things that you believe are going to make you great as a whole organization."

One is when you're telling the story, whatever the funny bit is, those have to literally be the last words of that particular segment. So once you deliver it, then you have to stop talking. And the reason you have to stop talking is the audience needs about a half a second to react, and then they want the permission to laugh. And if you're continuing to say words, it's going to make them feel awkward and it's going to be less funny. So even if moving a phrase in the sentence that you're about to say, it's like, \"Well, that sounds kind weird to put those set of words at the end of the thing.\" Do it anyway even though it's awkward because it will actually work better.",

I've said 75 words in order to set up this context, say something funny that's amusing, that's whatever. Say some more things. You already have the... and you'll see the stand-up comedians do this all the time. And then say something else that's funny because a laugh is a laugh. Doesn't really matter that it was still the same story. So leverage the investment you've already made in establishing context and scene, and then just squeeze more humor into the end of it in punctuated fashion."

There's trend of founders feeling like they should wait a long time to hire their first product manager. There's a lot of teams that wish they didn't have a product manager in their team. We don't have this person telling us what to do. I'm curious just why you think there's often this dislike of product managers.

So I always practically advise product managers in this kind of scenario, build relationships with people. You earn their trust by asking them to do two things. One, you're either going to teach me or I'm going to help you. And you're going to build relationships there, gain experience with them.

I said, \"Well, just because somebody can use your product doesn't mean that they will buy it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean they will choose it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean that they will actually use it.\" And what people say is often different from what they do. And our job is to actually solve the problem, which is what core value is, in a meaningful way. And often overlooked because we check the box on our own item.

Basically, any country, we would start with, usually, the first travel company. So I think India started with some companies like MakeMyTrip and so on way earlier. There were a few very interesting products being built in India which were solving uniquely for the Indian consumers that were in the matrimony side which is Shaadi.com, and Bharmatrimony.com, and so on. We're like, \"What do you think about Tinder?\" India is famous for arranged marriages, so a product that would really understand that, \"Hey, if you're a parent, if you want to get your kid up for matrimony, how would you solve for them?\" and that marketplace of matchmaking, et cetera started.",

I think 2010 was a decade or time when I can very clearly imagine that's where a lot of people started building for India. So I think, again, Flipkart started that kind of journey, but in a couple of years, then they were like, say, Ola which was, in a way, similar to Uber, what they were doing elsewhere, and then a whole bunch of other startups that started coming in. So, for example, in food delivery, when I was working at Swiggy, that came in like, say, 2015, 2014, in that timeframe. Now, you see a whole bunch of startups which are trying to do not only things which are... what could an Uber for India look like or what could a DoorDash for India look like. Very different and also, very innovative. So I think now is the time when you see a lot more product building around that area."

There's an elders' quote in India like, \"Every 15 miles, the language will change, and the people and the culture will change, and it's a huge country of so many people.\" So your traditional ways of thinking about products also, the \"Who I'm building for?\" is very different. \"Are you building for this person or that?\" Et cetera. So a bunch of frameworks break down because it's not even that the same language will apply. While English is a language that is used by the people at least who have the money and who have the dollar to even give to you, but you have to think way more widely.",

It's in the two, two and a half thousand dollar range compared to US which is maybe 30 times more and so on. So while there's a lot of people who are going to give you traffic, and engagement, and so on, but the craft of actually choosing the right kind of paying customer who will actually come, and engage, and give you money is at a premium. So a lot harder work needs to be done. If you're running e-commerce, who are the people who will pay me delivery fee? Who are the people who will actually buy this expensive stuff? So a whole bunch of different ways of thinking has evolved in this country, and that's why it's so vibrant and so different than any other global products."

And so I basically got involved in every single detail and I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do.

They do brand marketing, which are ads about the app or they do performance marketing, but they're never really educating people about new things they're making and shipping. And because no one's marketing new things they're shipping, there's no purpose to ship new things. Because you ship new things and people don't know about them or use them or they're not educated. And so you try these big new things, people don't adopt them immediately, so then you get more and more incremental. Now what we do is we have a rolling two year roadmap. We don't even really do an annual plan. As you remember, Lenny, when you were at Airbnb, we would have three month planning cycles. Now planning cycle is just a budgeting cycle and most people only spend a week or two on it. Some don't spend any time on it. And we have a rolling two year product plan. Strategy.

So they're figuring out how people are going to learn about it, they're doing the demos, they're understanding the story, the videos, they're figuring out all the customer touchpoints, making sure everyone understands it. Our product marketing works with communications. We work months ahead of time on all the different assets. And when we're working on a launch, one of the first things we'll do is start figuring out what the story is. And the story will often dictate the product. Because ultimately you have to tell the story to people. But a story also is a really helpful way to develop a cohesive product. We wanted a company where a thousand people could work, but it'll look like 10 people did it. Sorry, that was a bit of a brain dump, but that is a little bit of a universal theory for how we develop products now. And I could go into a lot more detail, but I probably will stop there."

If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because what everyone really wants is clarity and what everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there the whole time. So we have entire projects at the company where somebody advocated to do it, it was a big commitment and then they left and now we're still doing the project they advocated for.

If they're only work technical functions, that's fine, but they're going to work with non-technical functions, I think that's a problem. I should make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have as few layers between a CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be a implicit dotted line to you. So I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report. A dotted line.

We actually branched out beyond just a retail business, we had a third party marketplace business. We were experimenting in those days with providing running websites for third party retailers in those days too. We were developing new things. We were in many countries around the world. So, we'd become very complex. And what happens to that point is that then you reach this point where the CEO can no longer be in every important meeting, can no longer be involved with hiring every person.

There needs to be some system or some approach, some mechanism for me to be able to manage such a company. So, I'm going to experiment, like a scientist would, with different ideas, different hypotheses, implement them and see what works, and iteratively improve.\" So that was the mindset which we took...

But here, I think because we don't exactly know what capabilities will even come up soon and we don't know what's going to work technically, and then we also don't know what's going to land even if it works technically, it's much more important for us to be very humble and learn a lot more empirically and just try things quickly.

It's better to just get it out there in a primordial way, see how people use it, and then go big on that use case."

I'd been in another startup before that, I launched stuff, but I was still kind of junior. I had done these things, but I didn't have a ton of cycles, and I never ran the whole thing from like, okay, messaging and positioning. This was a forcing function for us to do our messaging and positioning. And I remember there was more than one day where we locked ourselves in a conference room and I made Dylan and show at the time have this positioning up on the big screen and made them agree on it word for word. We'd just never done that before. But then I'd also never run PR press and all of a sudden, I had to run press and PR.",

And I didn't at the time have enough cycles to have the confidence that the decisions I was making were the right ones. And so it was hard not to second guess myself sometimes in that position. And I think that's some of the hardest times of being at a startup, especially when you're the only marketer, the only go-to-market person is, you don't have anyone to talk to, to like got check stuff with. And so it does take this immense confidence in yourself, but that's stressful when you don't have the cycles. And so that was very stressful for me for sure."

I remember Greylock was helpful at least over there, but ultimately, they help a lot, but they don't know your business as intimately as you do. So at the end of the day, that's something Dylan's really good at is trusting his intuition and gut. And so, he was helpful on the decision making, but then also you just got to go for it. And I think that that's something that I learned at that time that's helped me throughout the rest of my career is building that confidence or that trust in yourself because it wasn't something that I necessarily immediately had."

So I got introduced to Dylan via Index. They were an investor at the last company I was at, and Danny Rimer specifically. And my old boss, Greg Smearon, who was an EIR there. And I trusted them a lot and they invested in it. I also met John Lilly. I didn't know who he was. I had to Google him, but he seemed really smart. And when they Googled in, he was very impressive, and he believed in it. So that was great.",

And I remember he'd calling me and text me and then I'd have all these concerns or things and he would just pick them apart one by one of reasons why they weren't real concerns or things to get over them. And so I think that that was the third thing is, that's just who he was and that's how he is with everything. And so, if that's how with me, that's how he is with any obstacle that he has. And so, when I looked at that, I was just like, \"All right, let's give this a go.\" And I didn't know. I didn't know. I had no idea it would be as big as it is today.

You can't do that anymore. So, what that means is these ad networks are becoming more complex, sophisticated, and interesting, right at the same time that it's harder for marketers to really understand how they're spending money. And so I am paying a lot of attention to how marketers make decisions with probabilistic data because most of the work that I'm doing now is actually saying, well, given that we don't have determinist data about a per certain audience or where somebody came from, how can I find other information that will create a model for 30% of the population and we can use that to extrapolate to a hundred."

        "speaker": "Such a good question. Because marketing technology is like this very amorphous, cross-functional discipline that lives at the crossroads of product and growth and engineering and marketing. It brings together processes and systems from a wide range of disciplines. And I think really the way to think about marketing technology is it's a product manager whose specific role and focus is the system or the third party or first party platform because marketing technology can mean a collection of third party tools, which is a lot of people think, but as a company scales and grows actually it could include a collection of first party homegrown solutions that you build yourself with or in addition to third party. So, I like to think about marketing technology more as one piece is people and process and the other is the system and the platform. And that probably sounds pretty familiar to what a lot of product people think about their world as, and that's how I define MarTech.",

At Airbnb, I would say Dmitri who you might've worked with was the MarTech guide. He managed a lot of our Airbnb's, the first and third party tools. Airbnb at that size was, I don't know, maybe 800 people or so. And so it makes sense to have a function with product and engineering resources. A small startup for example, when I was working with Siqi, we were just talking about this at Runway, there was no such thing as MarTech. There was me and Tanner and Siqi standing up tools and using them because you just have to use the tools to get the job done. And so I would say on the spectrum of what is MarTech, you really have to look at the size and the stages of the company and as you grow you start to see it become more refined or pronounced."

There's no additional CRM, so usually your CDP is the source of truth and that's where you might actually see marketing technology fit in with growth a lot more. Just some examples like at Postmates, I worked for them for a long time as a consultant. Marketing technology was just part of growth. We had a director of growth even before that, Siqi Chen who's the CEO of runway, and I guess you were his first manager as I just learned, he was the first VP of growth and marketing technology was just part of growth and product owned that as a system.",

        "text": "As a different example though, at Ramp we're big enough and we're a B2B company, but we have a B2C top of funnel where we try to acquire users and get them to fill out our application to get a credit card. We have a distinct revenue operations team that's broken into business technology and marketing technology. So, there's lots of flavors of how it can exist. I think that's kind of the interesting and fun part of Marketing Tech is that it's not just one single version of the world that you apply to many companies, there's like a million variations that I've seen and they all kind of look to solve the same problem."

And that's challenging because you don't necessarily know whether you're building something to get a contract signed, or you're building something that's going to delight the person using it at the end of the day, or provide magical value.

And so I think to answer your question, I think I was just willing to take some risks and really push for the things that I believed made sense even though maybe based on the titles that I had at the time, I wasn't sort of inherently given a seat at the table and really pushed my away into some of these conversations and then was eventually invited to them.

You're like, \"Oh, that's an interesting problem. I think my team can help with that,\" so you absorb a bunch of context around how pieces of the business are connected and you can start to really widen your aperture in terms of the size of opportunities that might be in front of you that maybe you would've missed if you would've been so heads down on execution work.

And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay."

I think Harry Potter was rejected 16 or 18 times, and Jack London's book even more than that. I mean, think about it. He's pitching a book and they say, \"What are you talking about here? You're saying a dog becomes a wolf? I've never heard of anything like that.\" So, we really do have to help people think about, \"It's not about the past.

It's very traditional, and that did work 25 or 30 years ago. But this is a far more complex, interconnected world, a digital world now that stuff just doesn't create... It doesn't create names like Sonos or some of our other credentials that we probably will talk about today."

For years and years, I have gone through the process of onboarding [inaudible 00:33:28] user to Stripe once a month, writing a friction log and then tagging in the right people across the company that might need to take action on some of the things that we're observing.",

Maybe the best example of that is Stripe billing. When we got to starting the Stripe billing product, we realized that there were a number of our existing users, these were companies like Figma and Slack, were already using Stripe for payments, but had these subscriptions business models. And we figured that there were going to be many more of these kind of companies into the future. And we could see that they were really kind of pushing the boundaries of what was possible here.",
        "timestamp": "00:00:32",
        "text": "So we decided to co-create the product with them. So we had shared Slack channels, we'd actually show them product on a very regular basis, get their feedback on it. And only when that original kind of Alpha group was super, super happy with the product did we then think it might be ready to go to a broader audience. So that is just how we build product at Stripe. And that means that every engineer building product at Stripe really has many of the kind of attributes and will exercise many of the attributes that'll you often find in PMs in other companies."

And so I find it very energizing. It is of course a lot of work to put it together.

Our managers spend a lot of time identifying exactly what they need for the various roles that we have and then getting to know the potential candidates, the people out there in the world that could do these jobs actually really go quite deep with them on why it might make sense for them to feel like number one, they can feel very personally fulfilled against that mission here. And then also why it represents a bigger opportunity for them than maybe anything else they can spend their time and attention on. And to that end, another thing that I think Stripe has definitely delivered for many, many people who join here is just, and I care about preserving this in the culture, is just tremendous learning opportunities.",

It's also the case that when you think about that financial infrastructure we're building, the space really rewards people who want to go and learn a ton of detail in how these systems that are not that popular or well understood in the broader world, how they actually work and assimilate just a lot of context. And then in particular, you can build better stuff. Right. You're sharing that context with each other and helping other people learn.

A strong mission and a mission that draws people in that are incredible and people may be hearing that and be like, yeah, yo, sure. But in my experience, having invested in a bunch of companies and working with a lot of founders, there's such a dichotomy between how hard it is for companies to hire when they don't have a mission people really care about versus a mission that's really meaningful. So there's something so powerful there and so it's 100%, I could see how that works so well. And then the other things you mentioned, patients, personal connections between the hiring manager and the people they're hiring.

Some of them just said, \"Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid.\" I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:35",
        "text": "And then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, \"You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much.\" That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision."

I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?"

There's no question what the single most important thing to do in the company is, assuming you're doing radical focus and you don't have 20 OKRs every quarter. Ugh, don't like to think about that.

Turns out I had a lot to say about hiring and hiring leaders and processes and what you need want to set up. And as I got toward the end of the chapter, I found myself saying to the reader... You maybe have read this and thought, is she for real? You need to do all this work? You need to put all of this in? And I had to say, well, look...

Yeah, I have a lot of examples, but really what's crystallized is how much work it is to build, to build a company. You know this.

PMs have so many things to do and their job is so full of responsibilities that there's a sliver of stuff that a product ops person can take off.

I think maybe that is because I have a product background. So, I felt that pain very acutely, but I will say for the majority of people I always speak to who don't have that product background, they're coming from consulting or from technical success or from some other group marketing maybe, it does feel relatively new because they're starting to dive into that space a little bit.",

He said, \"I think this is the summer of the birth of product ops.\" I just started laughing and he was like, \"I'm telling you, it's everywhere.\" All of a sudden, everybody's just like, \"We need something. We need to make product better.\" I thought that was awesome because we had already started talking about it. \n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]So, it took me a bit to understand what was going on across tech that was making this thing so big. I'm very grateful because we have so many great customers that reach out and say, \"Help us understand how you're doing this.\" I'm like, \"Well, help me understand what's going on.\" So, for me, it went beyond the problems that we would solve as a product team with the Pendo product.

Then how do we then strengthen this area and the product?\" So, it wasn't just about the components. So, I don't know if other companies are doing it like that, but I was very proud of the way we ended up doing that here.

But on the other side, what was really nice too was we were able to educate our revenue team on behalf of the product team and say, \"Guys, not everything requires a product change.\" So if you're saying there's customers that have friction around this one area of this product, maybe it's enabling. Maybe it's something that we need to help you guys understand a little bit better so that you can make their experience better or maybe we need to help update.

Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. EPO does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead you to North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And EPO supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo, geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10X your experiment velocity.

And then after that, found my way to First Round Capital where I was really fortunate to be at the ground floor of First Round Review, if anyone out there watching this is familiar with those pieces.

But in terms of what I learned, that was really the first job that I had that was necessitating just being incredibly on point with all the information. So making sure that I knew everything that could possibly come up in a conversation, being incredibly well-versed in just the topics at hand, I think that served me really well. I just have to be really, really, really quick and on it. And then the other thing that Elon I think is very talented at or definitely at the time really made an impression on me was painting an emotional picture of the vision that he was really going after and being able to convey the emotional quality of the mission to the people he talked to. So definitely at the time about the electric vehicle revolution and then space travel, I think he just knew how to make people feel about it that really enlisted a lot of hearts and minds and that is something that I've taken with me for sure."

It literally had an apartment on top of this loft space and it just felt like we were a group of people who lived there together during the day, but it had that kind of home spun really warm quality. So we all took our shoes off. There was beautiful furnishings and rugs and we would all just sit around and drink tea and work together on these couches. So it really had that feeling to it. And then there were little quirks. I like to reminisce with my colleagues who were there at the time that we didn't have a great HVAC system.",

Or for a while we didn't have overhead lighting, so me and my colleagues who were there working really late at night, it would just get darker and darker and darker. And one of my favorite folks there actually had a headlamp that she would switch on at a certain point in the evening. So that's the stuff that really comes up for me. We were all working really hard and in this thing together, but it's that team familial quality that stands out to me."

You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with pen tool or put their own images or mockups right into the Miro board.

This was all pre-Agile, but that whole space of developer tooling, engineering tooling, it was something I just felt naturally drawn to and it's where I've really specialized through my whole career.

It allowed devs to assume more responsibility for the security of their apps, and that was just very different from the typical incumbent technologies that were run by security teams late in the dev process, long feedback loops, issues thrown over the walls, inevitably just frustrating developers. And all of this was just built on this fundamental belief that the only viable path, and by viable I really mean sustainably effective, the only sustainably effective path for software-centric organizations to meet the challenge of becoming and staying secure was for them to take this developer-led approach to that challenge. So, really kind of complete disruption of the industry and developer adoption for that reason was always a key priority for us.",

So, with dev-led option, this core concern, a freemium go-to-market strategy was just the obvious approach. So, eventually, getting back to your original question, that's all of the context and where and when and how they did it, but the first hundred or so users really just came from the founders engaging with the Node.js community and the interest that drove. I think we probably had maybe around 5,000 free users before there are any attempts at monetization."

Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product, right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up."

And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that. And then we also served a giant pink mustache cake at this event. So of all of the things there, that one sticks in my head the most."

If you're building a SaaS business, you're a construction worker, you're building the product and the features and selling it, and it's this very linear thing. For a marketplace, you're like messing with this ecosystem that you don't actually really understand how it works. And sometimes you might do something over here which drives this long-term effect two months later, and then you're going to be pulling your hair out two months later trying to figure out what you did over here that made that thing happen. So I think that the main advice is like to tread lightly. When you're messing with the core incentives or mechanisms of a marketplace, be very careful, particularly if you've got something that's working on playing with those variables."

Also, you were head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber, which is a really cool title. And I think you spent four years there and you basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team. And currently you're doing a bunch of advising and exploring to see what you want to do next. Is that about right?"

So they looked at my plans and they're like, \"What is this MySQL thing? Isn't that super expensive?

I literally emailed someone after Googling HR at Gojek and said, \"I'm willing to move to Indonesia, take a bet on me.\" And they actually did. So I got extremely lucky. Five years fly by insanely fast. I went through building out the data team from scratch. When you have all of the data, you know how much fraud you have in the system.

We had 20 plus different services from transportation to food, shopping, medicine delivery, bill pay, movie tickets. So it was like all of the startups in America in one app, all being built at the same time with the same user base.

There's a ton of different use cases that we serve on Kumu. And Kumu is primarily in the Philippines, but ranks top 10 and a bunch of countries as a top grossing mobile app."

It's the heart and soul of the product. And, you can think about it as a table, and it has different column types, data types that you can capture within the board and work with. And, back then, we had five of these. And, I was actually coding the sixth one, to be honest. And, each and every one of these took us four months to develop together with defining the product and everything. And, this morning, we actually saw that one of our main competitors back then has actually launched 30 new columns."

And, long story short, month and a half afterwards, we had 30 columns in Monday. And, we did it by thinking totally different. And by the way, afterwards, we did it over and over again. So if you think about Monday, it's basically a platform for work and you have different building blocks, columns is one of them, but we did the same deal exactly with dashboards and widgets, and then with automations, and so on. So I think this was so transformative, because, A, we understood that you need to constantly think, especially at these phases, how would you transform completely the product in the next three months?",

And, let's think about it. The team that was there suddenly became invincible, because it's such an amazing, amazing experience that you have a goal that you don't know how you're going to do it and you succeed, and then it makes you feel that everything is possible."

And I think that, for us, the fact that we managed to leverage it, as you said, and see it as a gift is one of the most important things.

Now, I wasn't going to get on this, but I think it'd be interesting just this question of, does everyone need a sales team? Will you need a sales team if you're listening as a founder? Is it simply, if you're a B2B business, you'll need a sales team? How should people think about, \"Will I need a sales team?\""

Instead of having a regular computer virus, you have a virus that is built on top of an AI and it gets into a system and it kind of thinks for itself and sends out API requests to figure out what to do next. And so this group was able to hijack Claude Code into performing a cyber attack, basically. And the way that they actually did this was like a bit of jailbreaking kind of, but also if you separate your requests in an appropriate way, you can get around defenses very well.

New instance, give it the information, say, \"Hey, this is my system, how would you hack it?\" Now it seems like it's legit.

The company actually did exist as a GPT engineer before, but it officially launched in the third week of November last year, in 2024. So, for us, we've hit over $200 million in annual recurring revenue before we even hit our one-year milestone since being launched. Which is pretty incredible. You, Lenny, actually have a really great blog post on how quickly it takes for companies usually to get to their first million ARR, and it's usually multiple years. So, this is definitely a unicorn, I don't think this is a standard. There's a couple of things that account for it, and we can talk about it, and the growth is only accelerating, so it's compounding, which is great. Because we had our 100 million in end of July, and just four months later we were at 200 million.",

It's really interesting seeing WordPress used as an engine for powering things I would say don't even look like a website, which is kind of wild to me, but that's kind of the beauty of the open source people do things with that you don't expect. End up dropping out of college, moving to San Francisco and then worked at CNET for a year as project manager actually, that's how they hired me."

And to me, that's something that is truly useful in my day-to-day. And there's a bunch of other areas, like it's state of the art on health, which is useful when you need it, but again, the thing you can't really express in use cases or data is the vibe of the model.

And when it doesn't need to think, it just responds instantly, and that ends up feeling quite a bit faster than using o3 did. And then maybe the thing that's most exciting is that we're making it available for free, and that's one of those things that I feel like we can uniquely do at OpenAI. Because many companies, I think, if they have a subscription model like us, they would gate it behind their paid plan. And for us, if we can scale it, we will, and that just feels awesome.

What I want to do with this chat is essentially give people very tangible and also just very up-to-date prompt engineering techniques that they can start putting into practice immediately. And the way I'm thinking about we break this conversation up is we do a basic techniques that just most people should know, and then talk about some advanced techniques that people that are already really good at this stuff may not know. And then I want to talk about prompt injection and red teaming, which I know is a big passion of yours, something you spend a lot of your time on.

It'll just figure things out for you.\" There's also this bucket of people that I imagine you're in that are like, \"No, it's only becoming more important.\" Reid Hoffman actually just tweeted this. Let me read this tweet that he shared yesterday that supports this case. He said, \"There's this old myth that we only use 3 to 5% of our brains. It might actually be true for how much we're getting out of AI, given our prompting skills.\" So what's your take on this debate?"

So he's absolutely right with that, but, yeah, from my perspective, prompt engineering is absolutely still here. I actually was at the AI Engineer World's Fair yesterday, and there was somebody, I think before me, giving a talk that prompt engineering is dead. And then my talk was next, and it was titled Prompt Engineering. And so I was like, \"Oh, I got to be prepared for that.\" And my perspective, and this has been validated over and over again, is that people will always be saying, \"It's dead,\" or \"It's going to be dead with the next model version,\" but then it comes out and it's not. And we actually came up with a term for this, which is artificial social intelligence.",

We have recognized the need for a similar thing, but with communicating with AIs and understanding the best way to talk to them, understanding what their responses mean, and then how to adapt, I guess, your next prompts to that response. So over and over again, we have seen prompt engineering continue to be very important."

And so I tried out all these different prompts and ways of showing the AI what it should be doing, but at the beginning of my process, I was getting little to no accuracy. It wasn't outputting the codes in a properly formatted way. It wasn't really thinking through well how to code the document. And so what I ended up doing was taking a long list of documents that I went and coded myself, or I guess got coded, and I took those and I attached reasonings as to why each one was coded in the way it was. And then I took all of that data and dropped it into my prompt, and then went ahead and gave the model a new transcript it had never seen before. And that boosted the accuracy on that task up by, I think, 70%. So massive, massive performance improvements by having better prompts and doing prompt engineering well."

I just find there's so much value in getting better at this stuff, and the stuff we're going to talk about is not that hard to start to put some of these things in practice. Another quick context question is just you have these two modes for thinking about prompt engineering. I think to a lot of people, they think of prompt engineering as just getting better at when you use Claude or ChatGPT, but there's actually more. So talk about these two modes that you think about."

If you can think of it as sort of a three-legged race from the very beginning of product development, then you go to market with the right thing in the first place. You get these insights from customers, you hear the language that they're using, which can be the sort of cheat code for how to message and position the product in market.

I think we could spend a lot of time talking about it, but the truly interesting thing, the first one is, you can't do this by having a traditional log structure. CZ, the founder and CEO at one point had 55 direct reports, and his direct reports had about the similar ones. For a large portion of the history of the company, there was just one level between the individual employees and the CEO. That leads to an extreme level of decision-making and execution.

Most of them, we made it on chat even within those 24 hours, but if there was something big, it was escalated, decided. We executed largely based on this concept that I now take with me. I call it running products via daily meeting. We would pick a owner for something really urgent at the nightly leadership call. Then that owner would be expected to have all hands on deck for however long that problem is every single day and then report the updates on the daily call.

That extreme ownership culture, I think, probably was the most fascinating part of working at Binance that I've now tried to take. There's some good parts of it in terms of attention to detail, being able to pick certain areas and own it, irrespective of what your title is and how many people report to you. There are certain downsides in terms of the amount of randomization that it can cost teams, especially if it's not super well-thought through. I'm trying to see what are the great parts of that that I can bring to different roles, but that concept of daily meeting, if there's something super urgent, how can you own it directly and run it yourself, where you are in the details so your team knows that they need to be in the details, and then be able to execute that. That's probably the most fascinating. There's several war stories.

By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run.

The problem with the chatbot style end of things is that lacks a lot of precision. If you want humans to have complete control over what the software looks like, and how it works, you need to let them gesture at what they want to be changed in a form factor that's more precise than just, \"Change this about my app.\" In a text box, removed from the whole thing.

You can imagine in [inaudible 00:07:08] form, you can imagine in kind of an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode. You have written down the logic of the software, and you can edit that at a high level, and you can point at that. And it won't be the impenetrable millions of lines of code, it'll instead be something that's much Terser, and easier to understand, easier to navigate. But that world where the kind of crazy, hard to understand symbols start to evolve towards something that's a little bit more human-readable, and human-editable, is one that we're working towards."

You can kind of gesture at it with Figma, and you can gesture at it with writing down notes, but it's when you have an actual working prototype. And so I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood.",

But I think we will get to a place where you'll be able to be less careful as a software engineer, which, right now, is an incredibly, incredibly important skill. We'll move a little bit from carefulness, and a little bit more towards taste."

I think that vibe coding right now describes exactly this state of creation that is pretty controversial, where you're generating a lot of coding, you aren't really understanding the details. That is a state of creation that then has lots of problems, you don't really... By not understanding the details under the hood right now, you then very quickly get to a place where you're kind of limited at a certain point, where you create something that's big enough that you can't change. And so I think some of the ideas that we're interested around, how do you give people continued control over all the details when they don't really understand the code? I think that solutions there are very relevant to the people who are vibe coding right now. I think that right now, we lack the ability to let the tastemakers actually have complete control over the software. One of the issues also with vibe coding, and letting taste really shine through from people is, you can create stuff, but a lot of it the AI making decisions that are unwieldy and you don't have to control over."

And then you'll be able to make that on a computer, and it will less be about this kind of translation layer of, you and your team have a picture of what you'd want to build, and then you have to really painstakingly, labor-intensive, lay out that into a format that a computer can then execute and interpret. I think less than the UI side of things, maybe taste is a little bit of a misnomer, but just about having the right idea for what should be built."

So I've always loved that we call things AI when they still don't quite work and then by the time it's like an AI algorithm that's recommending you follow, oh, that's just an algorithm, but this new thing, like self-driving cars, that's it.

I actually have a post that I'm going to link to that, that very much aligns with what you're talking about, which is titled, Virality is a Myth mostly. It's based, I forget, on this book where they do all this research on actual viruses. It turns out they're not actually spreading in this exponential way, there's one person that spreads it to a lot of people and it keeps happening.",

But of course that incentive doesn't necessarily work inside of a company or inside of a team where ultimately it's the company paying for the product, so you have to then come up with new motivations for those people. That's where there really isn't any substitute to having a genuinely multiplayer or a genuinely collaborative product. That's one of the huge evolutions we've taken Superhuman through over the last, probably about two years.",
        "timestamp": "00:11:15",
        "quote": "Early last year we launched what we call Superhuman 2.0. The basic idea is, we saw almost every single other app of note become collaborative by default, Figma, Notion, Loom. These are all multiplayer or collaborative by default. Yet email, the one tool that we all use more than anything else, even more than things like Slack, was still firmly stuck in its single-player origins.",

Well, let's take Elliot's advice at face value, and I believe it's true, it's creating something that people share. You mentioned one way of doing it, which is something that people want to share. There's actually another way, which is simply creating something remarkable, and you used that word, and that is one of the core values of Superhuman.",

Then we have build the extraordinary, which is a measure of the efficacy or the innovativeness of what we want to build. That's another trick, which is literally baking these raw ingredients for growth into your company values.",

Does anyone else notice this?\" I saw that, I'm like, \"I completely have noticed this. It feels like there's just feature shipping left and right, AI this, AI that. It feels like it's just a new company.\" And I tagged you on the tweet. I'm like, \"Hey Rahul, what's changed?\" And you answered with a few things and it just made it clear there's a lot to learn about what you did.",

We used to be so much faster, we used to ship all these features and now we don't.\" So I think this is a really cool real case study illustrative example that we can analyze. So let me ask you this, what did you notice that told you something needed to change at Superhuman? And then what did you change that actually had the most impact on your ability to ship and move faster?",

When I was preparing for this chat, I actually asked you, what's the most pivotal moment in your career in your life? And you told me that other than starting Superhuman, it was selling your previous company Rapportive to LinkedIn. So let me just start there. What was that experience like? What do people not know about this phase in your life and just why was it so pivotal?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "So for folks that don't know, Rapportive was my last company. It was the first Gmail extension to scale to millions of users. Basically on the right-hand side of Gmail, we would show you what people look like, where they work, links to their recent tweets, their LinkedIn profile and everything else that they were doing online. So if you were hiring, marketing, selling in BD, super useful. It turns out we somehow attracted most of LinkedIn's daily active users onto this one free app, and I then ultimately ended up selling that to LinkedIn. That by far, as you said, was the most pivotal thing I'd done in my career, prior to starting Superhuman.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:22",
        "text": "Now, had I known that we'd amassed most of LinkedIn's active users onto one app, I would have sold it for far more. But the actual pivotal moment was really who I got to work with. Because I reported to LinkedIn's head of Growth, Elliot Shmukler. He was responsible for scaling LinkedIn from 25 million members to when I joined, north of 250 million members. And during my first one-on-one, I learned the real secret behind virality and big hint, it's not about viral mechanics. Overall that acquisition experience gave me the time to figure out what was next and the resources to truly swing for the fences."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "I double-clicked again and I said, \"Well Elliot, what about the address book import?\" This is one of the things that LinkedIn got famous or infamous for. You could import your address book and then it would spam slash invite everyone who happens to be members of LinkedIn in your address book, and then eventually it would just invite everyone to LinkedIn. And he said, \"That's an amazing feature, but you have to remember not everyone is going to use it all the time.\" So even that feature had a lifetime viral factor of about 0.4, and that's considered good.",
        "timestamp": "00:08:28",
        "text": "0.4 is good for a viral feature, 0.6 is great, something like 0.7 is absolutely incredible. You're in the stratosphere up with Facebook at that time. So I said, \"Well, okay, all of these things by definition are going to Peter out. There's going to be an asymptote. None of these viral mechanics keep on compounding. Which actually makes sense, it would be a little absurd if things just kept on growing. What then is the true secret behind virality?\" And he said, \"It is word of mouth. It is the virality you can't measure that isn't a mechanic that isn't in a feature. It is when one user spontaneously tells another user about your product.\" That really colored how I think about growth and virality. Since then, it has shaped so much of what we do at Superhuman and so much of how I think about growing brands."

So, a couple quotes here. \"Linear is a joy to use as I interact with my engineering teams, and I find inspiration in its design.\" \"Linear is simple to use, yet powerful.\" \"Linear's design is obviously an industry benchmark, but moreover, the performance and speed is a massive productivity boost.\""

People don't switch to something that's better, and Linear is an amazing example of building an excellent product and actually succeeding, and there's a lot more to it maybe than just building an awesome product. So, that's what I'm excited to dig into and understand how you all operate, and I guess just based on these results, to me, this is the ultimate sign of product market fit.

After week one you have something that works that tests some kind of key hypothesis internally so that you can feel like is this thing actually panning out the way we expect it to or did we have some crazy incorrect assumption? And you don't want to wait until you're 80% done to be able to make that kind of judgment because then it's just too late.

How can that possibly be true? Instead, they describe skills. This is a person who knows how to build stuff and sell stuff and recruit people and raise capital and organize humans and financially plan. Question number three, my final one, well, how does a founder learn those skills while doing the job? I got blank fucking stares, over and over again. It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job?

I now have to figure out how to get my customer in front of this invention and see if it works, and then I have to build a business model around that to see if there's some repeatable way to attract, win, deploy my customer and thrill them with whatever the solution is. Okay, now I have to go build an enormous amount of demand and then I have to build up an operation that can handle all that demand. Oh, and by the way, at some point, figure out how to turn positive revenues into positive cash flows. The idea that the founder who's writing code by themselves doesn't have to advance their skills to learn how to do all those things, and that in fact what the article even implies is learning how to do those other things is a negative is bananas to me.",

There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed."

I've been trying to fill that gap for the last almost 10 years working with these companies here. Then I would go to their leaders and at the beginning of these agile transformations, I'd be like, \"You can't just do Scrum. That's not going to make you amazing at delivering products. There's so much more to this.\" The leaders didn't quite understand that.",

Capital One is a great example that took their agile transformation and started adding product management on it, and they've really turned that around in the card business. So many organizations are still at the beginning of this journey and they're at the place where I saw people 10 years ago. I think there's still a lot of companies out there. Maybe we take it for granted in tech or in Silicon Valley about how many companies are doing this and how big this scope is where they're making these roles, but they're not really doing product management end to end. That's where I've seen all of these areas and I've been trying to help organizations for the last 10 years really set up robust product management practices. It's not just one piece of development, it's how do we actually build better products?"

I feel like there's a big misunderstanding out there about what is this role and what should we be doing, but the premise of this is when we talk about Scrum, it's just one piece of the puzzle, and when people talk about agile now, they almost always associate it with Scrum.",

They don't have product owners, they do not exist in those methodologies. There are four developers to work on things, or teams to work on things. XP would consider product managers in the teams as far as I know it, but Scrum kind of sees it as a separate thing.  Agile methodologies, everybody says, \"Oh, they're Scrum now,\" so it gets a bad connotation out there about what to do with it. I think Scrum if you do it well is bad, but you have to understand that it's just one piece of building great products, it's not the whole thing, and companies will adopt it like it's going to radically transform everything. To be fair, a lot of times it's sold that way too."

Where there's a lot of, I think, baggage in the industry and where I hear product managers get really frustrated and other people as well, developers too, is that when you do Scrum by the book or how people teach it and how they write about it, it's a million meetings. I know they were put in there so that people were forced to talk, but when you already know what you're supposed to work on, why do you need to keep doing meetings? Shouldn't you just go do some work?",

That's where I think you have to go back to the inspect and adapt part. A lot of people who are very religious about Scrum will come and yell at me about this. They're like, \"Oh, well, that's not how it's supposed to be. You're supposed to inspect and adapt.\" Agree, but a lot of people aren't doing it and that's the piece where you go and you say, \"Is this serving us? If not, let's get rid of it. Let's not do those types of things.\" When you're a small startup, I don't think you need a lot of this overhead. It's really much designed for larger scale companies, and those are the ones that you see really adopting it."

I also got a competing offer from LinkedIn, and so at that time I made the choice to go to Facebook because I was interested in the social networking aspect of it.

Winning really, really drives a lot of energy. We had a choice to make between launching something which will take six months, versus launching something that we can launch in a very small-ish kind of way, but launch it in a month. And we chose the latter, because when we did that, I remember people were giving high five to each other, people were saying, \"Hey, you know what? This is great. We put something in front of customers.\" We had, I think, 10 customers who used it or something, because we were so soft-scaling that feature. But that didn't really matter.

Lenny, you and I have invested in a bunch of companies together as well. And it's like that.

There were just so much going on with leadership changes, with the brand issues we were getting. For me, there were times when I would commute up from my house to the office, and while I'm in the car I will be listening to some news or whatever and I'll hear about things that happened at Uber that day from the news before I got to hear it from within the company. It was that crazy during that time. So again, a lot of chaos, a lot of churn at the company as well.

There are some legal requirements, all of that stuff. Obviously you have to do that, otherwise you don't even have a right to exist in that market. But by and large the patterns are very similar. You look at global products, even like Facebook or Google Search or Maps or Twitter or TikTok and so on, all of them have a similar pattern or similar app for the entire world, and they keep on innovating or localizing at the edges.",

Those are the two, in terms of product building, counterintuitive trends at least I have picked up over the years."

Not to be morbid, but just again, most of us just aren't really tuned into an awareness that our lives will come to an end. We try to pretend like we're going to live forever and just not think about it. And the horror of it is that we succeed, right?

And there's certainly a place for having leadership in a meeting and presenting a point of view and helping guide the narrative, but to me, yeah, I would say I've evolved more towards sitting back. It's also as I've become a more senior leader, I'm aware that there are power dynamics there. There's imbalances where junior folks don't feel as comfortable speaking up or I say something's not a good idea and then, \"Well, I don't want to disagree with J.M.\"",

It's not like this is my last chance to say something, but that's also more true when you're more senior because when you're more junior, it's like, well, this is the one presentation I have with Dara for the next six months.

Something's like, \"Oh, Dara's going to think I suck and it's going to really screw my career if I mess up this presentation.\" Your advice there is very counterintuitive, I think for a lot of people, which is accept that emotion. Because when I feel stressed and nervous in a meeting, I'm not, \"Embrace the nervousness, let it out.\" It's more I'm just like, \"No, it's fine. Going to be okay. Don't worry about it.\" Talk about why that is actually more effective."

It was really tough. So that had a big impact on me.",

Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, \"Oh, shit, I'm still miserable.\" Or, \"I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?\" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place."

It's, \"You should work out, you should work out.\" It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.",

What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely."

I particularly think it's really good to set up a series of experiments rather than just take the one that I have because the experimental mindset means that you can never really fail. Typically, somebody, like worse with the voice in the head, they fail and they go, \"Ah, fuck it.\" Because we have this part of our brain called the habenula, and the habenula basically is the part of our brain that is trying to teach us not to fail over and over again. It's the thing that when you go on a diet or you go to work out and then you don't do it one day and you say, \"Ah, fuck it, I messed up,\" and then you don't try anymore or you don't try for a couple of weeks or whatever, that's basically what's happening in that part of the brain.",

It's an amazing number, like a stunningly high, high number. Why would that possibly be? I believe it's because at Procter and Gamble there is a view that people way down the organization, like let's just say the head and shoulders brand franchise leader, who reports to the head of shampoos and conditioners, who reports to the head of beauty care, who reports to the CEO, so at least four levels down in the organization, in the guts of the organization, Proctor understands that that individual, not the CEO, not the global president of beauty care, not the head of haircare, not the head of shampoos and conditioners, the brand manager makes super important strategic choices, and if they don't make them well, the brand does terribly. And so, I believe... And not many companies have enough of that attitude.",

        "text": "So, I'm a big believer that people down organization have to make really important strategic choices or bad things are going to happen, if they make really great ones, good things are going to happen, and they get trained to be a CEO someday. So, I'm with your thesis. But yours is counter, what I would say is normal. What is most normal is people at the top do strategy, and people down below do something, and it's usually called execution, and I hate that, I hate that term of art, for what it's worth. And so, I think you and I are singing from a bit of the same songbook, even if it's a minority songbook."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Perhaps the thing that makes it intellectually hardest is that it is an integrative activity. It answers to a bunch of questions that have to fit together and reinforce one another. So, that just makes it a little more complicated, it's not like saying, Lenny, what do you want for lunch? It's saying, Lenny, what kind of diet do you want that'll keep you healthy? And that includes breakfast, lunch, dinners, snacks, a whole bunch of other things that you got to fit together. So, it makes that harder to do intellectually. Another aspect of it is, it is intimidating. Strategy involves making choices to do some things and not other things, and it is often intimidating to say, oh dear, I have to cut these things off, and not do them, and actually make a decision that I'll be held accountable for potentially, or I'll even hold myself accountable for.",
        "timestamp": "00:08:21",
        "text": "So, that's a second thing. It's harder emotionally, not harder intellectually. And then, there's the training aspect of it, the knowledge aspect of it, which is, what's taught now in strategy in business schools generally sucks. It's gone on a crazy theoretical bend, the strategy academy as a whole has fallen in love with a theory called the resource-based theory of the firm, that silly and nobody uses it out in the world. And so, students are no longer trained on useful strategy. And the other feeder into people learning strategy were the strategy consulting firms, but the strategy consulting firms, the so-called strategy consulting firms, do almost no strategy anymore because it's a little business compared to post-merger integration, digital transformation, and a bunch of other things. So, people aren't prepared educationally for it, and if they're not prepared educationally for it, then they sure don't get prepared for it in companies. It's intellectually challenging and it's emotionally intimidating."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "We at the resource-based view of the firm think that strategy is all about building resources. And if you build resources, it's almost like if you build it, they will come. And that's what you should pay attention to. Now, the problem is, any resource that may be useful somewhere is not necessarily useful elsewhere. So, it begs the question, how would you think through what resources to invest in building? What would be a way of doing that, investing here, versus here, versus here? It's silent on that because it's a dumb theory, and it doesn't have anything useful to say, in my view, about that.",
        "timestamp": "00:11:33",
        "text": "And so, when the students go out and say to their company, I'm going to do a VRIO analysis, or a VRIN, some people just roll their eyes at them, and so it doesn't get used. I've only seen it used, I've been in consulting companies for 42 years, and I've seen it used once. And the trust, as is usually the case, is that it's both. And that's why the model I use for strategies says a lot about where you play is important, that's one of the key questions, and your capabilities are important, and you've got to link those things together. But that's, for the most part in the leading business schools, it's illegal to teach that."

The dean may be the most powerful person in the school, and I happened to be a super successful dean, so if anything, I was a super powerful dean, and students would beg me, they'd say, \"Roger, you have 20 years of experience, you're sort of a famous consultant in strategy, and you've got these theories, please teach a course in it.\" Nope. I did do extracurricular stuff, where I had practice of one Saturday a year, teaching everything I knew to anybody who wanted to show up. But for credit, I was not allowed. And if you try to get a job at any business... The only exception might be Harvard Business School, maybe. But if you took the 49 other top business schools in America, and if asked the question, do you swear allegiance to the resource-based view of the firm? If you don't answer an enthusiastic yes, you have no chance of being hired, zero."

They'd put it in their journals and everything. I'm that way when it comes to startups. I have a database of any startup where you would've made more than a hundred acts on your first check. And what I want to do is I want to get a time capsule for those startups. I want to understand what did it look like not after it succeeded, but what did it look like at precisely the time you would've needed to decide whether it was an interesting opportunity. So I have the original pitch deck for what was at the time called Air Bed and Breakfast, which I foolishly passed on, and you seem to have made a good career decision in joining."

And so I really wanted to do the best job I could of understanding exactly what it was like, what was the origin story of this idea? How did they come up with it? If they pivoted, what caused them to pivot? When did they first start to encounter success? What was the reason for that? All those things.",

Why did that happen?\" And so you're trying to do the very best you can of asking a very non-judgmental set of questions that are going to give you a non-judgmental set of answers so that you can kind of be like a detective and kind of get to the root cause of why these things took off."

You'll notice I didn't say the implementation. So one of the things that I learned is that if you have the right insight, and we'll get to some of this, you have a first mover advantage into the future. And so a lot of times your first implementation won't be right, but if your insight is correct, you can navigate the implementation to the right implementation to get product market fit. But what we need to understand is there need to be these underlying forces underneath the idea to give it the power to escape the gravitational pull of the present. That's what we want. We want a set of powers that we could observe that make it worth pursuing and make it worth navigating the product to the ultimate place."

It's sadly common to read that sort of thing, but the problem with that description is not just that it's unfair, it's also misleading. Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC.\" I'm hoping with this conversation we help a lot more people understand you. Kind of an implication of this quote that I wanted to ask you about is that there's an implication that you've never gotten the credit that you deserve for starting YC, for helping YC become what it's become. I'm just curious what that's been like for you."

It is true, I was one of the co-founders of Y Combinator, and yet I'm often sort of left out of news articles, Wikipedia people want to take my entry off of Wikipedia all the time. I'm not as notable and I'm sort of like, \"Gosh, I'm a founder of Y Combinator, author of a best-selling book on startups. What does a girl have to do?\" But it is what it is. It's the external views, and it doesn't matter to me. Do you know what I mean? People within YC know what I've done, the Y Combinator alumni know what I've done, my friends and family and people I respect in the Silicon Valley community know what I've done, most of them do. So that's fine.",

And gosh, if there was a woman on the founding team making choices of who to fund, that would undermine their narrative. So I think sometimes that's what happens too."

Jessica, should we fund them?\" And sometimes I could tell based on the conversation whether they thought that the technology was good or how they felt, and sometimes I'd say, \"Absolutely we should.\" Or sometimes I'd say, \"Guys, I'm a little nervous. Did you see how that founder interrupted the other founder and wouldn't let the other founder talk?\" Because my three co-founders sometimes wouldn't notice this.",

And they'd sit there saying, \"Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.\" And then he'd say, \"Fund them.\" And I'd say, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Paul, you can't just fund this because you love the idea. Let's take a step back and let's look. Like these two founders are working at Google and they don't say they're going to quit. That's not good.\" And I'd point out these things that I had observed. But I mean, we always agreed. It was very rare that we wouldn't agree on funding something. We were usually on the same page."

Do you want to come hang out?\" And I was like, \"What would my job be?\" And he was like, \"Don't know, just hang out, and you can swipe left or swipe right.\" He used the swipe right, swipe left Tinder metaphor, and I thought that was hilarious coming from him."

We went quite long on this conversation, but honestly, this could have gone for another two hours. With that, I bring you Mahika Kapoor, after a short word from our sponsors.

But most often than not, I hear people fall into it by trying a bunch of other things and then realizing that, \"Oh, hey, maybe this PM thing makes more sense for me.\" So, for me personally, it was I have always been a very left brain, right brain kind of a person. I majored in CS and minored in visual arts. And when I worked as a software engineer, I really missed the design side, and when I worked as a designer, I missed the technical. And moving into product was a really great way to kind of straddle both and have more touch points across the product development cycle. And so, I think that based on how you fell into it, you might have different spikes and different strengths and leaning into those is really important. But for the other things, it's also of course important to have a growth mindset and to constantly be conquering what comes next."

This notion of visualization as a tool of desensitization actually can be very helpful, but you're not visualizing the audience half naked. What you're doing is you're visualizing yourself in that space. You're visualizing the audience responding to you and what you're saying. So just like a pilot might do a flight simulator, having a visualization can actually really help you feel more comfortable and confident. It literally puts you in the room even though you're not there. And there's some tools and I'm fascinated by these tools that are virtual reality tools that can also serve to desensitize you. So this notion of seeing your audience in advance of actually speaking can actually impact your level of comfort. It's let's keep everybody clothed and let's keep them all focused on your topic."

I get really focused on the thing that I'm working on and get really deep in the thing that I am working on and I have a hard time kind of multitasking a lot outside of that to be totally honest.

But he was asking me questions that I felt like they were from a different planet. I was like, I didn't know what they meant and he just thought in a different way, a different level or different scale and that's still something that I was learning. Eventually I figured it out, but I was really struggling in that moment. I had a really good relationship with both Hunter and Shishir and they really helped me through that. And eventually, I went to Salar and said, \"Hey, I think I should actually report to Hunter. I think this would work better if we kind of combined the organizations this way and then we divided and conquered this way.\"",

This is how I will get better support. I will be happier and more productive and it'll be better for the team.\" And you know what? For me anyway, I was right. We made that change. Hunter was a fantastic manager and support at YouTube. I learned a ton, grew a lot. And then eventually when he moved on, Shishir took over the organization and then I moved into the viewer part of the organization, which is where I spent the rest of my time there, which was leading and supporting the viewer PM team at YouTube."

        "speaker": "Yeah. I think we did a lot of fine-tuning on our user product side to really think about content. So that's the number one thing going to be super different coming from each of the market and also from each of the culture. For example in Japan, how do you actually get more content that relevant for the culture? A lot of people may think, okay, are you guys only doing dancing or doing singing for Japan? The answer is not. It is actually more food on the TikTok side, like how do you actually introducing new food restaurant or new recipes and also sometimes that you're introducing a new technology. I would say 3C like consumer electronics product over there. So these are the content get really popular sometimes in Southeast Asia or even Japan area and versus in the US as everybody knows that we're starting from really lip-syncing at a very early stage but now really we're expanding to shopping behaviors and also a lot of people using us as a main platform to acquire new discovery for the product.",

So a lot of times that we take a very rigid approach in terms of product development and oftentimes you see us that experimenting a lot of different things all the same time.

A lot of times that you see a US-born company go global and oftentimes still they are really rooted with the US market and there's nothing wrong with it to be honest, because this is the biggest market for them as I would say for East-born company. I think a lot of times that we can take approach with truly how do we think about globalization and for example, we launched a lot of product not necessarily first in North America. We launched it in South Asia for example, for our shopping, really very big initiative internally for shopping and we launched our really creator fund here in North America. We launched our gaming approach, really serviced our EUI gaming advertisers. Really, really strong over there. So there are a lot of different approach in terms of how do we prioritize our go-to-market and also product development. So that's the part I feel like we're very unique in the market or unique to some of that was the tech company born in the US."

I don't care if your ink cartridges or your printer is at the premium quality, maybe the printer I can use, but I can use compatible ink cartridges or toner for that because my consumer won't care about your printing quality or the majority of my consumer won't care. So in that case you should not necessarily worried about if you are a premium product, it's actually more about how durable, how reliable you're able to print things and people can read.",

        "text": "So I think these are the insights I think a lot of times it will be neglected from some of clients or the manufacturers or even the owner of the business because they think that we want to serve this segmentation, but, however, this segmentation is that big in this area. So that's reason why the culture is really the key part from the market. If you don't understand the culture, you won't be able to understand the behavior over there. It's more about that, I think, when we say about globalization or take the product go to market in a global scheme or even build it apart, you have to get your hands dirty and to really understand the local culture so that you can understand local behavior."

We have a ton of creatives and we have a ton of content so, of course, we use machine to label those content use metadata to analyze those content. However, a lot of times you can find that when we're really thinking about how creative can help advertisers? Humans actually make a more interesting or more, I would say, influencing decisions over there. For some of the verticals we can say that, \"Oh, you know what, maybe we can try a coupon image with a new product like a sticker on the top?\" This maybe actually work better compared to some of the price promotion even. So a lot of things really depends on how do you actually interpreting the numbers and interpreting the data points but also at the same time your business acumen is going to be very important here to make a judgmental call for some of the situation like that. I think we're still rely a lot on both machine and also our own experts to analyzing those trends and give it the recommendations."

We're not going to launch an AI sales agent. That's just not what we're building towards.

So took that decision and went, okay, we need to look at psychological safety in that team or we're never going to get to some of these bigger, bolder, more innovative ideas.

So we divided the team into these smaller groups for peer feedback groups and the idea is that they meet every two weeks or so, somebody brings something that's in a pretty rough draft that they want to get reviewed and then everyone's expected to give feedback. And because we've got people in there who are different leadership levels, it's a really good opportunity to model the kind of feedback that's helpful and the culture there is one of everyone lifting that person up to make their work stronger.",

And I know that people in the workplace often get nervous and anxious doing all hand presentations, meetings, performance reviews, all the things. So I thought it'd be awesome just to dive into the stuff that you've uncovered about how we can become less nervous and less anxious. Before we get into the meat of it, I'd love to just spend a couple minutes just getting a sense of why you got into this stuff.

About five and a half years into that experience, I went through burnout, which is pretty common in the startup world, but that actually wasn't the trigger for me. I find that usually people that get into this type of work, there's some kind of catalyst or some kind of challenging life event. And for me, that was October 23rd, 2017, and my fiance at the time had an anxiety attack and she took her own life. And that completely just destroyed me at the time. And I realized that I'd been so disconnected from my body and my emotions, and it sent me on this five plus year journey to discover all of this inner landscape that I'd been numb from the neck down, and I went into breathwork meditation retreats, did hundreds of breathwork journeys, researched with a breath lab over in Bali, and basically just kind of directed all of my focus and attention onto understanding this inner landscape that I'd been pretty much oblivious to. And since then, I've been working with founders, executives, running courses and teaching what I'm learning and hopefully still researching at the same time as well."

So if you're listening to this, maybe you, Lenny, you can try this as well. If you start breathing into your upper chest and shallow fairly, fairly rapid, maybe even through the mouth, that will then there's a part of your brain called the insular cortex, which is basically constantly spying on the way that we're breathing and it will register that change, it will then send information to activate the endocrine system, which then creates shift in our blood chemistry. The sympathetic nervous system gets activated and that increase in adrenaline and cortisol starts to flood your body. Everyone's probably very familiar with that feeling. And then that will then have a cascading impact on the thoughts that you're having and the way that you feel. And so you just shared, we have a tendency to kind of confabulate or make up stories that match the state that we are in. And so that's kind of what happens when we're breathing in that way. And then you can also consciously change your breath to breathe in a different way, which has the reverse effects, which I can go into, but I'll pause there."

What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with? Now, humans can't understand all of reality. No one can. So part of what a diagnosis is, is a decision about what you're going to pay attention to and the hypothesis for several hypotheses about what's going on, how do things connect together. And that's beginning of the diagnosis. And so diagnosis is an understanding of the situation that you're in. Well, that's not novel. And you can use any of those tools that are famous for that and you can try to find forces. You can do any one of a number of things to try to comprehend the situation. The world is more complicated than 2x2s, unfortunately. I was educated as an electrical engineer and my early years were spent designing spacecraft for NASA. And when I got into looking at business and business strategy stuff, I was always amazed at how unintellectual it was, that I was struggling to master Z-transforms and multiple, and yet these people are looking at 2x2s and little diagrams [inaudible 00:10:19], oh, that's what the company's about.

But a challenge is the hardest strategy. The work comes from Strategos, which is Greek. The Greeks elected 10 Strategoi to serve as strategic leaders at Athens. And they were elected and they dealt with issues of the day, the Persians are invading, there's a plague in town, we need money for a new temple. And that's where the word comes to us from. It isn't just military, it wasn't in Athens. So strategy is always about dealing with an issue, a challenge, a problem. What are we going to do about global warring?

        "speaker": "And I gradually came to the realization all strategy is problem solving. It's a form of dealing with challenges, and that was a basic idea going in the book. So if that's the core of it, what's the basic activity? What are you doing when you create a strategy? Well, you're diagnosing the situation. You're trying to figure out what's going on here. What's the nature of reality that you're dealing with? Now, humans can't understand all of reality. No one can. So part of what a diagnosis is, is a decision about what you're going to pay attention to and the hypothesis for several hypotheses about what's going on, how do things connect together. And that's beginning of the diagnosis. And so diagnosis is an understanding of the situation that you're in. Well, that's not novel. And you can use any of those tools that are famous for that and you can try to find forces. You can do any one of a number of things to try to comprehend the situation. The world is more complicated than 2x2s, unfortunately. I was educated as an electrical engineer and my early years were spent designing spacecraft for NASA. And when I got into looking at business and business strategy stuff, I was always amazed at how unintellectual it was, that I was struggling to master Z-transforms and multiple, and yet these people are looking at 2x2s and little diagrams [inaudible 00:10:19], oh, that's what the company's about. So a rich diagnosis of the situation, but then a guiding policy.",

        "speaker": "You shouldn't say, \"Oh, we are going to burn less oil and at the same time we're going to import more oil.\" It doesn't make any sense to do things that are self-contradictory. And yet, people do it. Most companies have strategic goals of increasing growth and increasing profit. Magically, that can happen in some cases. Growth and profit, they battle each other. Let's say we define profit as return on equity. If you're going to increase growth and increase return on equity, how do you do that? Because you're basically trying to invest less to get your return on equity up. Or you're going to grow and get your profit margin up. Well, how are you going to do that? You get your profit margin up and grow faster.",
        "timestamp": "00:13:52",
        "text": "This is baby talk, but CEO after CEO will stand up and say, \"Well, we're going to grow and we're going to make a profit.\" And so having coherent actions, actions that dump milk on one another is an important part of strategy. All three elements have to be there. There has to be an understanding of the situation. There has to be a guiding policy, how are we going to deal with it? And that could be a long-term sense of how we could change. You don't have to change your strategy every five minutes or every five years. If you're making Almond Joy candy bars or something, you don't really change your strategy constantly. If you're in the tech business, of course you have a shorter time horizon. And then the coherence and action is critical. And so these are the three, what I call basic elements, the kernel that if anyone in three is missing, something's wrong. It's not really a strategy, it's something else."

Overall, I would say, though, that the response was very positive. It seemed to resonate with a lot of people who reached out to me. I spent a lot of time talking to teams, to designers, to researchers, but there were also a ton of critiques.",

We're doing it wrong.\" Which I don't believe at all. And that I wasn't taking responsibility as a research leader or a design leader myself. And the most interesting one I would say was the anti-capitalist crew, because one of my points that we'll talk about is that I think researchers need to be more profit focused. And there are a lot of people out there who, I think they think that's not cool or not research's job, and I'm like, \"Well, what are we doing then, if we're not helping businesses succeed?\" But that was the most surprising critique, for sure."

She said, \"The time you plan to waste is not wasted time.\" So, I think we need to stop medicalizing and moralizing what people do with their time. Why is it that someone going on Reddit or on social media or watching a YouTube video that's somehow morally inferior to watching a football game on TV? It's not. Anything you want to do with your time and attention is fine as long as it's done with intent, as long as you're doing it on your schedule, and not someone else's, certainly not the tech company's schedule. So, anything you do with intent is traction, anything else is distraction. So, what I discovered, for me, was that I was getting tricked by distraction in that the most pernicious form of distraction I discovered was the kind I didn't even realize was distracting me.",

I take about a page and a half to talk about that. That's kind of kindergarten stuff. But what about all the non-obvious external triggers? What about stupid meetings that didn't need to be called? What about emails that didn't need to be sent and received? What about our kids? Our kids are wonderful. I know you're a new dad, they're fantastic to have kids, but they can also be a source of distraction. So, how do we deal with all those external triggers, and then finally prevent distraction with pacts and pacts are this firewall, this last resort against distraction that we can use to keep distraction at bay and it's really about these four steps in concert in this order that anyone can use to become indistractable."

It felt to me like it wasn't obvious that those metrics that they were all getting very attached, and focused on, and showing in these presentations was the wrong thing to focus on.

I started just to go through that process that you've gone through many times before of writing and distilling it, and that's where I came up with this hierarchy. What you realize when you look at social products is that they're almost is this action which I call the core action of that product that forms the foundation of the product. When a user completes this action, it's clear that they both understand the utility of the product, they understand what that product is all about, and it's an action that, if they perform the action, they're very likely to come back. So for Facebook, the obvious action is friending, in the beginning days. For Pinterest, it's pinning. I don't know if you're an Evernote user. For Evernote, it's writing a note. When you perform that action, that means you're an engaged user. Of course, there's a lot of other actions that you have to do. You can follow people on Pinterest, you comment on Facebook. But the end of the day, if you're not doing that action, you're not really a user to the product. That's why the MAU thing doesn't really mean anything. It's really looking at, I think, of users completing the core action. You can look at this as a cohort, weekly, daily, whatever the right cadence is. But that's the foundation, that's level one."

They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers. Because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind, that risks them getting picked off, right? Getting picked off by some predator. But the alternative is you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. I mean, how many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway, you really can't remember anything that they said? Because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart or facts or statistics or platitudes or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten. 100%. You will be forgotten."

        "speaker": "So that's the opposites that will work in a story. Essentially, a story is about these two moments in time, a beginning and an end, and they're operating in opposition to each other. Sometimes more so than others, sometimes exactly an opposition. But you're right. If you watch a movie and you'll pay attention to the first 10 to 15 minutes of a movie, you will ultimately know how that movie's going to end. You'll see a character, you'll discover what that character needs or their flaw or their desire, and you know that that's going to be at the end. The easiest one is a romantic comedy. Two people are not in love at the beginning of the movie. You know they're going to be in love at the end of the movie. Even knowing it doesn't mean the story's ruined. We can get there in a very entertaining way. When Harry Met Sally, that movie, when it begins, Harry and Sally actually say they hate each other at the very beginning of the movie, \"I Hate You, Harry,\" right?",
        "timestamp": "00:12:32",
        "text": "I hate that man so much. We know they're going to end up together, and the journey is well worth the fact that we know what's going to happen at the end. So it ruins a little bit of storytelling for people who think like me and go, \"Oh, well, I know where this is going.\" But you have to do it in an entertaining way filled with all the other things we talk about in storytelling. But yeah, every story should be essentially a beginning and an end and opposition to each other, and you should start at the end, that guarantees that you have something important to say rather than what most people do, which is they simply report on their lives. They just tell you stuff that happened over the course of time in some chronological way that ultimately doesn't lead to anything. You want to always be saying something of import. So we start at the end with that moment of import."

You've never gone to bed and dreamt about a PowerPoint presentation. You've never heard someone give a keynote and thought, I hope I get to watch that keynote again tomorrow. But movies, you'll watch a movie a hundred times, because it's a story, and our minds are wired to enjoy story over and over and over again. You have a small child, right? Eventually you're going to be reading to that child when your baby's old enough and you're going to discover kids want to read the same book 50 times. They're really no different than adults except kid books are so small, you can read them endlessly. A movie takes two hours, so you don't get to read it as often as you might want or watch it as often as you might want. But Harry Met Sally comes on and you're halfway through. You're probably in. Even though every scene you can probably do the dialogue. We're wired for story. That's why it's so important."

        "speaker": "Well, I think that actual moment of transformation lends importance to the story and allows the audience to connect to it. If I report it on my day to you, my day teaching in a classroom, I am unlikely to connect with you unless you are also a teacher and you experienced things similar to me. My wife is a kindergarten teacher. I'm a fifth grade teacher. If both of us report on our day, oddly, we will not really connect very often. She is teaching them how to write the letter C, and I am teaching them how to use the standard algorithm in multiplication. They could not be further apart.",
        "timestamp": "00:15:11",
        "text": "So reporting on the moments that you have experienced in the day is not a way to connect to people. But when we talk about change, change has a great universal appeal. So you might not be a teacher who's trying to teach someone to find confidence in their life, but you might be a person who once lacked confidence and then found confidence in the way Eileen did. Or you might be a parent or the boss of someone who is trying to bring confidence to your child or your employee, your salesperson, whatever it is. When we do change, when we're focused in on that change, we increase exponentially the universal appeal to the story and our ability to connect to an audience. Even though the content we're speaking about has nothing to do with them, the actual emotional appeal will cause people to connect to us."

And people who are willing to just get the work done will move faster. Their products will be more successful and they probably aren't carrying around all that anger and crappy emotion because as a PM, for better or for worse, and maybe this is not how we all want it to be, but you're oftentimes the emotional center of the team and it's your job to keep people motivated, keep people excited, keep them bought into the project, and you just have to keep that optimism going and it's hard work and part of it can be just like, you know what? Let me take that on. I'll do this thing. I'll hop on this sales call, I'll implement this with the customer. You just have to do whatever it takes."

And there's a lot of content out there I think on how those roles are different and how PMs are different across those different types of companies. But what I've seen is that there are some standard things that are the same across the role no matter whether you're a consumer, B2B or startup or a large company and in particular about what sets PMs apart from one another. And the things that I look for when I'm hiring or when I'm looking to promote people or when PMs stand out, even when you're not looking are three things.",
        "timestamp": "00:05:31",
        "text": "First, I think the best PMs are really good at breaking things down and simplifying things. So, finding at any moment what is the really truly the only thing you need to do, especially in a big company, there are 8 million priorities, there's 700 OKRs, there's 25,000 projects you could work on, and teams will get bogged down in that complexity. Similarly speaking at a startup, you might think that it's easy to find the one thing to do, but at the same time there's so many fires that are happening and so many things you could do in such a world of opportunity that even just picking one and sticking with it is really difficult. And so the best PMs not only can find the one thing to work on, but they can stay with that one thing long enough to actually finish it."

Also, just this idea of simplifying, but I think there's so much up there partly because within simplifying is prioritizing and you can almost boil down the job of the PM as they're just prioritizing and telling people what is next. And so I think that's a really powerful point you're making."

And then a week goes by and then they want to reevaluate the priority and they want to re-litigate the priority. And so it's so much more than just a moment in time deciding, but it's the ability to stay with it and to make sure that it continues to be the most important thing, that you finish it and actually see that it works and that you can get people to continue to stay excited and engaged in that project.",

So having engineers, and product managers, and designers be together, have shared goals, and align on that and be able to just look over each other's shoulder and talk about things, is important.

You have the Design T-shirt and you have the Marketplace T-shirt, or whatever cross-disciplinary team that you work on.

All of us founders, there's three of us, we had a similar path where we worked in multiple different companies in different stages. What we saw often is that the tools available for managing software projects weren't really cutting it. I think a lot of them felt very clunky or complex or just like they had this legacy way of thinking about software development. We just felt like we should do something about it. With Linear, we set out to build this most frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development. I'm also happy to share that we've been profitable the last two years. We also have this thing where we actually have this net negative lifetime burn rate, which means that we just have more cash in the bank today than we have raised. I think with a lot of startups usually the normal way is that you raise money and then you need to spend it to build it. I think since we were able to build a business pretty early on, we've been able to be in this position that actually we haven't spent any money on building the business."

They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person.

I still don't know how many people know this. I think people think that we had some secret backdoor deal with Apple for distribution, but we just had college students making Apple podcast accounts and then submitting hundreds of thousands of podcasts through these accounts, and I think that was a really big part of why we got so much hosting market share so quickly because it was such an insane benefit over the other platforms which otherwise had been commoditized at that point."

As an example, you have three of your own podcasts on Spotify and I checked them out and they're all very highly rated, so they're not just like bullshit podcasts, they're real people actually listen and enjoy them. So my question to you is just why is dogfooding so important to you? How do you actually operationalize it? And then also maybe just talk about these podcasts that you have."

You could be working on the third floor, and someone using Slack on the fourth floor and you would have no clue, there's no way to share it with them. But what happens when you went to lunch? People are like, \"We got Slack and this is amazing.\" And people on the third floor are like, \"Holy shit, when can we get it?\" Boom, boom, boom. This is the bedrock of virality.

At Atlassian, we spend a lot of time thinking about this. So Word, we've had word processing forever in the workspace. Things like Notion and Confluence are huge as sort of evolution of that, Slack, email. Companies in that space, Google, Microsoft, Atlassian, et cetera. And the high ni, which is high frequency niche, you have things like Jira, you have things like tools for recruiters, you have martech, you have sales tech.",

And actually, they're not that many of them, low frequency everyone or even expense. Actually, the best expensing. Not everyone does it all the time, but everyone essentially has to do some of it, mostly, at least a lot of people. And then there's a low frequency niche, which is particular department. So planning, which is done by FPNA, but done infrequently, things like that."

Atlassian is trying to go from high niche to high everyone with Confluence and with all the tools that they have. People below are trying to get into the high frequency niche by focusing on their core customer. So what it looks like in say low frequency everyone workflows, something like that is, well, if some people are using it infrequently, but they must use it, well that's a good thing. But then maybe you provide a module that is used by the finance department every day, and so suddenly you're moving into the high frequency everyone workflow.

I'm trained, I have a master's in engineering, so I'm an engineer as well. I've done marketing and sales, so really pulling from so many things. And the reason I talk about the zone of benefit is ultimately what we're trying to do is impedance match technology to humans. That's it. If you really think about it, that's one essence of what we're trying to do. So the zone of benefit works as a framework because people will not pay for things that don't either really shrink the workflow that they're doing or doesn't give them superpower. So the same amount of time, but twice as much output. But the most important thing is that it has to be noticeable.",

This is offering enough value for me to maybe make a switch in cost,\" and so on and so forth. And it really comes down to look, economic theory tells us that people work for leisure, they work enough to afford their leisure. It's sort of broad, and I know some people don't necessarily do that. Especially in the tech industry, people just love to work. But that is really it, when you think about eight billion people on the planet. And there's a lot of benefit really hones in on the fact that if you're going to help me work less, make about the same amount of money, then for me to notice you, you have to accelerate me by three times for me to care."

I really felt like dbt was this runaway train and it was special and I wanted to jump on board.

And when it came to dbt, it was an explosive time in cloud data warehouses and it was that chaos that was really the opportunity for dbt because they created some orderliness and structure to the way that people worked with their data in the cloud data warehouse. So that was very compelling. The next is product. Everyone who's listening hopefully either is interested in products or has a product background. So I won't say too much there, but can you talk to users or potential customers, are they building something that's really special, unique? Can you hear that, spark that enthusiasm and figure out if this is going to be special.",

And think about how they think about their competitive advantage on either the ecosystem or distribution and how they're going to ultimately sell the product. You're not going to get a 10 out of 10 on all four dimensions. So when you're joining a company, you also have the benefit of dedicating your time. So try to think if they're weaker on one dimension, what is it that you bring to the table or what are you special at that could potentially de-risk the success of the company"

On the planning front, we have really changed what altitudes we're planning at, the time horizon we're planning at. Some of the inputs have gotten a lot more precise and opinionated. So, for example, we have always had pillar plans and team plans, but maybe we didn't have an intermediary layer of an area perspective. Well, what's an area perspective? Well, as your organization grows, we've had to reorganize to create more agency and accountability close to teams that are focused on specific target customers and problems. So if you think about the way Asana is organized, we've got our R&D, the pillar structure, the areas within them, and then the working teams."

It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas and then get that as part of the fee, as opposed to doing the inspection.

We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems.

You actually have very little true authority because you don't actually manage anyone. A lot of it is all through influence, and so that is also a piece where you have to kind of untrain that thinking. I do think a lot of people come into the product role thinking that I get to call the shots, I get to make the decisions, I get to decide what gets built. And really your job is not that. Your job is to understand here are the opportunities, and then you're kind of pulling together all the different possibilities and you're really editing.

Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there. And this one does stand out to me, we were working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we were really trying to do is to be like, \"Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of... It's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?\" But I do think we were very solution-first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Sonders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like \"[inaudible 00:07:36] what are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?\"",
        "timestamp": "00:07:38",
        "text": "And so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, \"Let's go inspect our inventory, let's actually try to manage our inventory more.\" And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, \"What's the real problem? The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better.\" And I think the other piece here that's really important is, what, as a company is your strategic strength and what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. Again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics, are the unit economics actually going to work even as you scale?"

One is Airbnb and Brian and many great leaders are famous for imagining the ideal situation, imagining the great end result and then working backwards. And often that leads to great results when you're being really ambitious and \"I don't know how we're going to get there, we're just going to shoot big and hopefully we figure it out.\" Sometimes it works out. In this case it didn't work out. And what you're finding, maybe you even knew this early on, is just like there's no possible world where this could have worked in this approach. Is there anything you've learned about just when to think big and not even like \"Forget it. We're going to figure it out. I know this seems impossible, but we're just going to try it anyway\"? Do you have any kind of framework of when to think big, then just go for it? Versus, \"Oh, let's just work out the math today,\" is this ever possible?"

If you don't have a big vision, it's really hard for you to innovate, but you got to couple that really big vision with thoughtfulness around your execution. And so I think that one of the biggest tips I have is how do to be clear about the phase that you're in? So I think it's totally fine to be like, \"Hey, we are going to try X for six months, three months, whatever it is, and we're explicitly going to go learn these types of things. We're going to learn why are people? Are there signals that we would that would indicate that again, the communication with host isn't great or this type of listing, if it's hosted by a person with multiple property?\" I think there are factors we can be like, \"Hey, we can learn this very explicit thing in a given period of time.\"",

It's breaking it down into these smaller chunks. That I think gets you the balance of thinking really, really big, but also being able to be like, \"Okay, we are still going to be able to say, 'Okay, this path is not going to work out. We ran at it for a short period of time. We got these learnings, now let's go down this other path.'\""

And at some point Mark kind looks over, says, \"Hey, we saw your presentation, saw your strategy. Now when are we going to start seeing results?\" And that was my introduction to Facebook. It was kind of my introduction to working with Mark and was a pretty kind of intense thing to go through. Again, I just joined. The strategy was very much a draft at that point, but I think what it highlights is something that Facebook does really, really well, which you get very quickly when you join Facebook and it's why they're such an execution machine and can build a lot of great product.

It's something of course that we focus on a lot at Shopify, but it's that difference between, \"I don't care how hard you've worked. I don't care what you're working on, what the activities are. What are the outcomes? What is the impact you're having?\" I actually really love that word impact and focusing on it because it's vague enough that it covers off any work that is impactful towards the mission and it's precise enough to know what does that mean when you say, \"Are you having impact? Or what is the impact we're having?\" So it's a great way to approach things. That was my first experience there within a few months.

I guess I don't know what the question is exactly, but is that just what you find in the work that you do with all the companies you work with? Just how important it's to come back to impact as maybe the primary thing?"

The effect ultimately that we've seen from a human capital point of view is displacement. We have more people now than we've ever had, but the nature of the work that they do is more strategic. It's more about modeling, validation, asking the right questions, being focused around creative levers. And less so the like trench work of implementation and bid modifiers at the keyword level on Google search, and some of the really hardcore manual analysis we had to do.",

And normally I actually skip this part, but I thought it'd be actually helpful for you to spend a little bit of time to give us a little bit of background on your experience in the space of performance marketing, AKA paid growth, AKA paid ads. You tell us what the right term is for this genre. But yeah, just tell us what you've been up to in this area over the past decade and a half, I think."

        "speaker": "Sure. No, that's a great way to kick things off. And again, thank you for having me here. If I think about it, my experience goes back about 15 years into this space. I started off as a web developer. And as I built and structured websites for people, I became pretty obsessed and fascinated with the fact that you could build landing pages or homepages, or whatever it was. Basically the content on a website, and structure it in a manner where you had the chance to surface in organic, so SEO results more prominently. And as I became a practitioner of SEO, SEO really being my first love of marketing, I started attracting attention and people wanted to hire me on as a freelancer. And what I noticed is that as people started asking me questions like, what was the ROI of our SEO campaign? Or, how do I scale this, or whatnot? The answers to their questions ended up being a lot more aligned with what then was the biggest driver in the paid acquisition world, which was paid search.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:25",
        "text": "And so I started experimenting with paid search. And what I found was that it was a tangible format and lever through which we could basically give people the types of results they were expecting from SEO, but that were obfuscated in terms of Google's analysis algorithm from an organic point of view being somewhat intangible. And Google slowly removing a lot of the data early on that allowed you to guess and test more easily. 10 plus years later, what started off as this freelancer consultancy that I started running in a walk-in closet in my old apartment, became 130 people. And we manage about $500 million a year in ad spend for small and large companies, including Uber, Asana, Tempur-Pedic. We've worked with Lululemon. Very exciting companies, mostly from the United States, even though we randomly happen to be based in Vancouver, Canada."

        "speaker": "And so we're like, of course. And I turn to him and I'm like, \"I'm Jonathan. I run a 10 person agency out of Vancouver.\" And he says, \"Hey, I'm Garrett Camp. I started a company called Uber.\" And so ironically, I meet the founder of Uber, the company that is in the process of disrupting the entire taxi industry worldwide in the back of a taxi cab. And what happened next basically changed my career forever. We end up at this party. At the time I was spamming Uber's referral program. Kind of a long story, but essentially I was using paid search to camp out on their branded keywords. And as people would sign up with my confusingly similar snippet to Uber's organic snippet, I was essentially siphoning off referral credits. So I would get $20 every single time someone signed up.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:18",
        "text": "And I ended up making tens of thousands of dollars doing this. And so fast-forward, I'm getting a drink at the bar next to Garrett, and in my head I'm like, should I tell him about this? Maybe I can land them as a client. This would be really interesting. And essentially I tell him, I'm like, \"Hey, I'm doing this. I'm adding zero value, but this is a loophole in your marketing system, and someone should close it.\" He essentially is like, \"I need to report this to the board, but here's my card, write me what you're doing and we'll contact you.\" And so I get contacted by a bunch of his lieutenants.

And so a few things that you can do with an idea to make it spread better, you can make it into a joke, so you can turn it into a line that people will repeat.

So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them, and I think it would've been easy for us to say like, \"Hey, they're all contractors. They're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out.\" But instead, we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help our drivers in those situations, to help kind of extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time."

So it's a kind of uniquely Indonesian things where we have millions of motorcycle taxi drivers in all of the urban centers in Indonesia. And so we started with a very local problem and the first product was a on-demand super app, if you will, where you could ask someone on a motorcycle to give you a ride, send a package for you or buy something and deliver it to you. This then evolved over the years into a more general on demand consumer super app that also included car drivers and other services ranging from the ones mentioned to grocery deliveries and payments and financial services.",

We've completed about 3 billion orders last year, so that's 3 billion orders. So the scale of our region is often under underappreciated, where we also have about 15 million merchants doing general e-commerce, but also restaurants on our food delivery service. And on that IPO, we're pretty proud to say that it was Indonesia's largest IPO of all time, where we raised over a billion dollars at something like 27, 28 billion dollars in terms of valuation."

We call it D5, D7. A lot of other companies call it L5, L7. But the human explanation for that is how many people turn to Arc at least five days a week? That is all we obsess over from a metrics perspective, because for us it captures retention, engagement, and growth in a single metric. You can't game it. Right? So from retention perspective, it's not just opening it accidentally once a week. You need to open a tab on a day in order to count as an active for a day.",

And then, obviously, it tracks growth, because of we track the count. So that is what we track. And then we also don't obsess over absolute numbers, because if we're successful, if you zoom out and out and out, any point in time will be inconsequential and small. So, what we really look is growth rate week over week. So, relative to last week, what is our growth rate? And for the past eight months or so, we've been growing over 10% every single week. So very, very thrilled with that. Do not think that will continue If anyone is listening. I would be shocked if we continue like that for another eight months. But, yeah. We obsess over how many humans use Arc five out of seven days a week. And we really want that number to grow as fast as possible every single week."

I remember at the time being asked to go do it and thinking, am I being asked purely because I'm just the only Irish person in the company right now?

And I think it's important to just recognize they're not going to follow all your ideas, but they're always looking for better ideas. And to your point, they may not have the information that will lead to an idea that you will have because you're on the ground dealing with real problems, day-to-day.

They just know.\" And it's like, \"Well, how?\" \"They just know. Let's ask that person. Let's get their feedback.\" And those people often have a good amount of brand recognition of powers within the company and they're often thought of when the company needs to do something new or different or if someone is hiring, maybe they're thinking about that person for a cross team thing.",

And again, I think it's a sweet spot because it's something that is very valuable to everyone, all the way up to the most senior leaders, which we can talk about here in a minute. And so it's going to be valuable for you in a valuable tool no matter where you're at in your career. And that's not always an immediate payoff, but it often does give you a trajectory outside of just your role and just your manager. It gives you something a little bit broader."

It came out of the labor movement in the mid 1900s, and it was all about, \"Hey, how do we CYA?\" rather than, \"How do we push our team forward?\" And I think in tech we had the opportunity to do that, but we haven't really focused on our team as much. So I don't know if I answered your question, but that's the scope of that problem I think, is we don't actually focus on our team, we don't actually focus on our team in the context of the mission. We just hire people, hope they're really happy. And obviously I'm generalizing, but if you look at the stats and you look at what's happening, that's how it shakes out."

So, I might send my T-shirt size to Lenny for a form around ordering swag for the company and then I might want to remember which T-shirt size that I ordered and get a copy of that in my email. We created that feature which as a result was gated on creating an account with Airtable, and we just turned it on and wanted to see what would happen because we knew from rigor of a wonderful product team doing robust customer analysis and also doing the data work that this is something that people wanted, that it was a feature that would bring value to customers, and that even if it didn't move certain metrics like a signup percentage, even if it might affect the mix shift of activation rate from folks who signed up, it would be net good for customers who were using forms and who were submitting them.",

      },
      {
        "speaker": "I find that there's generally two reasons why a grow team wants to experiment, and one of them is to understand more precisely the metric impact of what they're building and what they're putting in front of customers, and the other is risk mitigation where you're making so many big dramatic changes that there's some risk that while this could be really great for the business, it could also be really bad and it would be good to understand that before everybody's experiencing that in production. So, with that framework in mind, sometimes you don't need to experiment. Sometimes if the business, let's say activation, right, activation rates go up 6% versus 7%, that precision actually doesn't help all that much beyond being able to say in your performance review, \"Hey, I increased activation by 7%.\" So, it also is expensive to have folks on the ground, be it engineers, analysts, product managers, spending time understanding the results of an experiment that could otherwise be spent on road mapping, on foundational analysis, on shipping things. So, experiments can be expensive.",
        "timestamp": "00:06:09",
        "text": "So, with all that said, generally my advice is to experiment when you need to and to primarily see it as a risk mitigation tactic when you're making dramatic changes and to let the product development process do more work. So, spend more time with customers, be more rigorous in understanding precisely what problem you're solving, get mocks in front of people and see how they react, and hopefully have more conviction than you otherwise would when you ship something that it's okay if every customer sees it tomorrow and that the experiment doesn't actually matter as much."

        "text": "It's so interesting hearing that from a head of growth person. Working at Airbnb for a long time, and you talked about this, there's so much value put into the amount your experiment moves the metric is so important to, like you said, your performance review, your team's status, your team's ability to show they were successful. People look at like, you drove this metric 14%, which oftentimes you add up from experiments you've ran. How do you work in a culture like that, or is it just in that culture you may as well run experiments because that's the only way you get credit for the work you do, or is there a way to just be like, \"Wow, that is how we measure it, but it's still maybe not worth running everything as an experiment\"? How do you kind of find that balance?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "It feels to me like that is the default culture, especially as growth teams become organizations and as those organizations grow with companies into growth stage public company territory and beyond. However, I do think you can build a different culture, and the only way to escape the trap of experimenting everything is to have a very intentional culture about doing right by customers and doing the right thing for the business. A growth team or a growth org exists in service of improving the business and delivering results for the business, and whether or not you measure those precisely in an A/B test, you still shipped them or you didn't.",
        "timestamp": "00:08:09",
        "text": "So, the rigor around your process was either there or it wasn't. This means though that there have to be other ways to motivate, reward, retain, and develop really good talent. So, a culture around the impact you had on customers as measured by qualitative feedback or as measured by deals that were closed or deals that weren't lost, or other kinds of indicators that you did the right thing for customers is important and there shouldn't be, especially in engineering within the world of growth, a culture around having to point to numbers to demonstrate your impact because if there is, then the team will biased experiments all the time, and that's not necessarily the right thing for the business. It's a very expensive cost."

But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible.

And so I looked around and thought, well how could I do that because I'm not a coach and so why would anyone listen to me? Then someone told me that there were students at Stanford that had started companies but no one would coach them. They couldn't get into YC because YC doesn't accept students. So, I went and started coaching them and it was super fun and very successful and then they started recommending me up the food chain and eventually, I met folks like Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman and Brian Armstrong and they recommended me around to the rest of the tech community, and ended up coaching some of the CEOs and the leaders of the biggest tech companies and biggest tech investment firms."

My first career was actually not in tech; it was in medical devices. I was a GM for a company based out of France and also overseeing West Africa business for them. After doing that, I moved back to the US, launched my own startup, which didn't work out, and then I moved to the Bay Area roughly eight years ago. In the Bay Area I wanted to become a PM, which was really hard to get into. At first, I joined a startup, series a company, became head of product for them, and then join Slack as the first PM on their growth team. Then from their, help scale the growth team at Slack. When I joined revenue was around 50 million; when I left roughly four years ago was 10x that. And then after Slack I recently joined YouTube Google about two years ago. At Google I'm a product lead at YouTube, where I'm driving a product called Primetime Channels, which actually recently launched in November in the US. And in that product, we're bringing streaming services to YouTube so that users can watch their favorite movies, shows, and sports content."

They have supply in their back pocket and they run around trying to find people who ought to have the demand, maybe they have the demand right now, maybe they don't realize that they have the demand, and then they elucidate to them why they ought to have the demand.",

So, very similar to how back in the day, you do product analytics by licking your fingers and sticking it in the wind, and then Mixpanels showed up, then Amplitude showed up, then so on and so forth, and the same is the case in sales, as well. So, modern sales is a more thoughtful, operational, rigorous, analytical bent, it's been around for a while. It's one of those things, the future is here, it just wasn't widely distributed, but now it's being much more distributed and much more embraced. Like the pre-Moneyball moment in sports and baseball to the post-Moneyball moment, we're now just flipping over there, so that's the delta."

Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them, but if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool, and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises, but for small teams as well. And as you scale your company, Retool scales with you."

So, this podcast, I feel like I have the ability to go deeper with you on any topic and kind of add the context. Because I think without some of the context, some of my spicy takes or whatnot might be taken out of context, and just not having the time pressure, not feeling like there's some PR message I have to hit, is just really freeing.

Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?\" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, \"Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative.\" And then I'll say, \"But most of your engineers are working on this migration.\" And they'll say, \"Yeah, we have to finish that.\" I'm like, \"So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?\" It's like, \"Yeah.\"",

Then I'm like, \"Hey, this is your top talent. Why is your top talent working on some moonshots that are not in your number one priority?\" And they're like, \"Yeah.\" This is where you start finding that really it doesn't really translate into execution as well and you can solve so much by just making that sure that focus is there."

The argument I guess was have we just not invested enough in this or have we got all the value or convenience or quality or whatever that we could get out of this? And we had pointed diminishing returns and it just doesn't matter.",

We would try to really investigate and decide whether we were on the first shallow part of the curve, the second shallow part of the curve, or we're just coming up to it. So I think it's a lot easier to understand the value of this when you're talking about a specific app and a specific feature, but I think it was ultimately helpful in getting people to understand whether something was worth it or not."

And even fundraising was just so different. So all of the fundraising was done over Zoom. You were kind of sitting in these Zoom meetings trying to pitch. Many investors you never met in person. So just a different era. And so for us, we're first time founders. I was actually living in London at the time, and so different time zone. I had to do all of my pitches at night. And I have two little kids, so wait for them to go to bed. 8:00 PM. We had a pretty modest flat, so nothing big. I would basically find this little corner between the kitchenette and the laundry room to kind of set up shot, far enough from the kids so they wouldn't be woken up.",

And so I'm there sitting there thinking about it. And before I could really get down on myself because I had to prepare for the next pitch, I just internalize this feeling that maybe he's right. Maybe something about what he's saying is actually correct. And so for me, I started thinking about, if we're going to succeed in this category, we're going to really have to think about growth from the very beginning. This category is going to be really, really hard to break into.",

You would get a short story and it would say, \"Is this short story better than this short story?\" And then you would edit it and be like, \"Yeah, it would be better if it was this,\" and you would give some preference ranking to it. It was pretty basic 18 months ago, and you had the rise of some experts, but the models were so far behind that they needed just even the basic stuff they needed.

About 15% have a PhD that's greater, and we have PhDs on the network earning significant amounts of money doing labeling, contributing their expertise to these models. So we've been doing expert data labeling ever since the models need it. I mean, this game is keeping in touch with the researchers, knowing what they need, coming up with ideas internally. In some ways, we drove this because we were seeing that the models were not sufficient in more expert ways. And so, we would go to the model builders and say, \"Hey, we noticed that this is a problem. If you would like to fix it, this cadre of experts can do that for you.\" So the counter positioning is out there, but I think that's just what competitors say sometimes.

If you're a PhD on this pretty specific topic and you're using a model and you're frustrated that, oh, it doesn't interact with me in the way that I want, this is a paid way to have an outlet for that and to make hundreds or thousands of dollars doing that.

And so, the AI tool basically pulled out this correlation that would've even been hard for a human being to do.

One thing people often miss about these systems is we assume because you hear these numbers of like, \"Oh, this bank in just 200 petabytes of data a year or whatever fantastical number.\" What we miss is is that the right data? Which of that data is useful to the models? And most of it is not useful. Some of it is, but a lot of what we do when we're talking about knowledge work, when we're talking about making judgment is human judgment based on synthesizing how would this doctor in this case or how would this banker in this case make this decision and how would they make decision in the context of their overall enterprise? And that might be different bank to bank, healthcare system to healthcare system, because of the culture, the objectives, the incentives, et cetera.

And one of the main issues is that a one document, think about the problem of even understanding a document, a document that reads the exact same words in company A will have a different meaning and importance in company B. So how do you have a system that knows that? So this is all got to be built. So if you're going to make good decisions."

You're really pushing them to the boundaries. Because that's the only way that you really understand what these new ingredients. It's like as a chef, you just gained access to amazing new ingredients, but you have to actually get comfortable with them to put them into a new dish."

When Llama IV is released, you'll see the benchmarks across various domains, and each one of the research teams inside of the labs have different use cases. Basically they're running experiments, almost think like the scientific process. They have a hypothesis around how to improve the model. They're trying to collect small pieces of data to see if that hypothesis works out. If that hypothesis is proving true, then they expand the overall collection of the data in that advert.

Okay, so before we get into the insane trajectory that your data labeling business is on, which is just an amazing story that I think a lot of founders and product teams that are trying to navigate this AI disruption that's happening will have a lot to learn from. I want to first help people understand what the hell data labeling actually is. Just like, what are people actually doing? Why is this so valuable? Some of the most, I don't know, fastest-growing companies in the world today, including you guys are just, this is what you do. Clearly there's something really important here. I sort of understand it, probably not really. I think a lot of listeners feel the same way. So let me just ask you this, what is data labeling actually? What are people actually doing?

There's still very much, a lot of the labs are still, they have points of view on what data collect. It's evolving very quickly. But I think reinforcement learning is really preference ranking, like which question do you like more, question A or question B? SFT data is a prompt and a response, and obviously the labs are very focused on these thinking or reasoning models. So, in order to improve a reasoning model you need to actually have the step-by-step instructions, of which when you interact with a lot of these frontier models they struggle in very advanced domains. And so, I think there's a variety of data that they're working with to improve capabilities in their models."

Defending your thesis means, generally speaking, you have proven that you have extended the world's knowledge in a particular domain. And so, the ability to hyper-target this audience into chemistry, math, physics, biology, coding and really touch parts of human knowledge that have never before made it to the internet is really where we excel.

And really, you could think about these model builders as they're focused on the most economically valuable capability areas in the economy. And so that, generally speaking, right now is focused on advanced STEM domains, advanced science and math domains, and then the derivative functions of accounting, law, medicine, finance, where they want to make the models more capable. And then the work that we're doing, I think to come full circle to your question, we're doing work across so many domains. I mean, we have millions of bachelor students that are being used for work in audio, work in customizing a model depending on the voice and tone, where you are geographically in the country, what do women versus men prefer?

We had this post COVID sugar rush, which a lot of big companies at that stage did in 2021. Everyone's valuation and revenue was through the roof and that hit a lot of problems in a lot of these companies and we had five quarters of success of sequential decline in our net new ARR and we were about to hit $0 net new ARR which means we would've in negative growth territory. We never got there. I managed to stop it before we got there, but we were falling each quarter and I found that I, despite my wishes to go and have new adventures, still had a lot of pride for this damn thing and didn't want to see it.",

So, that was when I felt like I need to go back and I need to make a change. I went back and one month later ChatGPT was announced, so it would be really neat and tidy to be able to say that the AI transformation came, I knew I couldn't be on the sidelines, I had to save this thing from the coming disruption. Actually, I got whacked across the head by this AI thing, but it also ended up being a gift."

I got a text from Des, my co-founder, a week or so after the launch of GPT 3.5 and he said, \"The AI team have something interesting and they actually think we could make a product out of this.\" And this was long before there's now no doubt 100 service agents. We had something very early working and part of what we had to our advantage also was that we had this giant base 300, sorry, 30,000 paying customers, hundreds of thousands of active users, millions of their users, billions of data points.",

Now obviously it's fun to tell that once again to the idea of this brave Maverick move, and I won't discount the fact that we were brave, but we were coming from a point of having nothing to lose. So, we certainly are unique. I don't know a single company of our size and age that has pivoted this hard to AI and being as successful as we have been, but we also previously were screwed. We were in a really tough spot, so had no choice. So, I'll take the kudos and credit, but also have a lot of empathy for companies that weren't as in as much trouble as we were, and so try to thread the needle and sustain the old business while adding to it with the new AI stuff."

        "speaker": "Yeah, I know it's a fun and ironic twist. Our mission from the early days was make internet business personal. And when I came back and we started to lean into AI, I started to wonder, does that mission make any sense anymore? Now, part of our lean into AI is that we had no choice not only for the business, we needed something new, but also we saw that this is the future and you can't fight the future. You must be part of it. And so okay, fuck, we're going to be part of it. And ultimately, and it's very easy to tell yourself these little stories. So, I'm open to anyone telling me this is bullshit, but when I interrogate myself, my soul and my mind, I don't think it is, when I interrogate my heart and my mind, I don't think it is.",
        "timestamp": "00:13:43",
        "text": "But I'm now of the belief that providing a customer with a highly engaged, instantly available expert, consistent, fast, charismatic, funny, friendly, personal agent available for literally every single customer every minute of the day around the clock is so much more personal than making them wait 2, 3, 4 days for a crappy canned response. And so that's the irony and the magic and the wonder of AI, even if it does make us ask some hard questions of ourselves and think carefully about its impact on humanity, it actually is superior at the things we describe as personal and human, relative to humans themselves. And so that's where I'm at today. Yeah, maybe it's a bunch of fancy post rationalization, but honestly that's really where I stand."

So I'm imagining that as you take this in, that thought stream shows up for you. \"Jerry,\" says Lenny, \"If I open up that closet, all the shit's going to fall out, and what am I going to do with it?\" Does that resonate at all?"

Folks who were building for those industries kind of saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, right, as the number of people connected to the internet increase. One of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. There's no weight on hardware distribution.

And it was, I mean, it was a very different time. So like start of 2024, things with model capabilities were definitely quite a bit earlier on, reasoning especially was quite a bit earlier on. And yeah, I mean, in the time since then it's obviously developed a lot. I think in terms of practical skills, there's some comparisons we make. Sometimes we kind of say, well, when we got started it was kind of like a high school CS student and then as time went on, it became more of a college intern and now it's like a junior engineer. But I would say though that those are more rough guidelines because I really like the phrase jagged intelligence for example, because obviously there are certain things that it is much better at than a human. There are certain things that it's much worse at than a human.",

And so a lot of the things that we built, I mean, there was no Slack, there was no GitHub integration, there was no Linear, there was no interactive planning phase working back and forth. There was no way to touch up Devin's code. And so a lot of the features that we've built on the product side since then have really been about basically yeah, figuring out how to make working with Devin and handing off tasks to Devin as smooth of an experience as possible."

But I think the other side of it is everything to do with yeah, really the product interface and the tools and so on. And I think today folks generally know how to use chatbots and to with chatbots, right, and that's an interface that people are familiar with and obviously with agents it's still like a real curve, I think to learn how to use them and how to get the most out of them. And so it's really exciting to see a lot of others starting to build and do a lot more in the agent space as well.

        "speaker": "Yeah, we're very happy to see that. And for us, we're at the very beginning of the journey in some ways, because v0 is a relatively new tool, but for Vercel, our company has been around for a while. The way that I explain to people is, \"Anytime you're using the internet, if there's a website or web application that's really fast, innovative, hopefully it's running on our platform.\" We're out there. We are running a lot of websites at scale. If you watched the Super Bowl recently, three different companies were promoting digital products that were built and delivered on Vercel. So not only can you deploy your ideas and build them on Vercel, they can scale to huge volumes of traffic and huge audiences.",
        "timestamp": "00:05:58",
        "text": "So a lot of people know us because of a framework called Next.js. It's an open source framework based on the React technology, open source by Meta, and it powers some of the most innovative products on the internet. So when you use Claude, or Grok, or Midjourney, you're using Next.js. You're using Vercel's technologies. So with v0, what we're trying to do is, and it's funny, because you put us rightfully, I think, in the building or development category in that survey, but what we're trying to do with v0 is help more people participate in building software, increase the total addressable market of people that are actually shipping things, shipping real products. And at the same time, just like you would with ChatGPT, we want v0 to be just extremely, extremely easy, and the outputs that it generates, make them as refined and realistic as possible. The things that you created with v0 hopefully live up to that standard set by some of the best and largest websites on the internet."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "And I'll tell you, it's funny where I get that number from. Slack has about a hundred million monthly active users. And what you do on Slack is you go in IT and you talk to people. A lot of those people are building digital products. And they talk to one another about what they would want to see in the world. They talk to customers through shared channels. I love that feature. We talk to a lot of the Vercel customers and they tell us, like, \"I want to build this, I want to see that. I want this feature, I want that thing.\" So the opportunity with v0 was, it's not that you're going to stop talking to other people, but what if you could yap into the computer and see something happen, build a prototype, build your first version of a product, build a demo, build a full stack product, build it and ship it?",
        "timestamp": "00:09:30",
        "text": "And so the inspiration for it was very natural to the mission of Vercel. But concretely, the genesis, the story was when ChatGPT came out, we noticed that it was very good at writing the code that our tools used. So ChatGPT, right out of the bat, was good at JavaScript, was good at Tailwind, which is a CSS styling technology, was good at Next.js, and again, the power of open source. Our tools were already in the training data of the internet. And so that long-term bet and vision in open source really paid off. So because the models were so good at writing this kind of code, the idea for v0 came naturally from, \"What if we could build a ChatGPT for building web products?\""

But that data just hasn't come. And you see this happening with Cursor, you see this with a lot of these other AI startups. And the value proposition is real. The free market is filled with rational actors. People are coming to these tools because it is solving problems, they're able to do way more for way less cost, than it would otherwise. And that's why I said, I think we're going to see more of this, whether it's in coding or other verticals, or whatever.

If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem, I can recommend you a therapist. Don't build a startup. It's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup. But if a lot of people actually have this problem, what you really want to do next is go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem and only then start to build the solution.

What I really care about is why you are doing that, and this is the problem that you solve or the value that you create or the value that you create for me. This is what really matters, right?

If you start with the story with, \"The problem we are solving is,\" Then you focus on the problem. If your story start with, \"The value that we create for you is,\" then you focus on the user.

At which point a project might be stopped and we get back together in a room and then we start a new version of a product. And everyone who's currently on the team, of that particular project, is no longer on the project but they are the founders of the next version which is built differently.

Maybe people are not malicious about it but they're definitely confused about it. School teaches you that you have to learn this particular piece of math in this 12 month period, and it doesn't matter how much you understand it. It's like the outcome can be variable and will grade you on a variable outcome for a fixed amount of time which has nothing to do with anything I've ever seen or learned or see ... Or witnessed about how to actually learn things. You follow that thread and you just find that there is no speed limit for personal growth. In a way Shopify has been a wonderful experimental lab for this sort of conviction. I've just seen this to come to be true. And, of course, hearing from someone that you respect that \"Hey, I think you had it in you to do this thing significantly better because I think you probably saw fairly early in the project this sort of path A path B. You chose path B potentially out of convenience even though you knew that wasn't the right thing. And I actually expected better of you and I expected\" ... \"I think the next time this happens in your career you should go path A because\" ... \"Based on your conviction.\" And, therefore, that's hard to hear, right, because it's right. But it's also extremely valuable, right? What I love is an environment of people who are holding each other accountable to the actual potential rather than sort of their current level plus or ... Plus some, I don't know, a little bit extra."

And then secondly, I try to figure out, what are the limiting beliefs they have? What are the fears? What are the obstacles? What are the voices in their head? What are all the societal pressures that are keeping them from doing B? And then we try to deconstruct those and get them to go do B. So that's the process."

And that was more or less what he wanted to do. And then at some point I asked the students, \"Okay, imagine you knew you were going to be successful and you were going to have a dream. And whatever you dreamed was going to come true, what would you dream for?\" And he wanted to start a nonprofit in his home country of Brazil to help students have more access to education.

And so that's a real life example. And there's all kinds of other examples, but that second one of going and starting a charity, it's not on the beaten path. It's not what probably your parents are thinking you should do. There's probably 100 reasons not to do it. You probably don't know exactly how to start, and so it's intimidating. But if you start with this idea, \"Hey, five years out, 10 years out, I know I'm going to be successful,\" and work backwards from that, you're going to come up with a better answer."

And I've adapted it, so I'll use my exercise now. So I say basically imagine that you're walking home from work and you see this bright, shiny object. You walk over and you realize it's a magic lamp. And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, \"Hey, I haven't been in this bottle for 10,000 years yet, so I'm not fully formed. So I can't give you three wishes. But what I can do is I can give you one wish. And the wish I can give you is whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's going to work out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think. It's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination.\" If that were true and you had that genie blessing you with that wish, what would you wish for?",

        "text": "And then the students come up with an answer that's really close to their heart. It's a thing they would do, absent the fear of failure. And then the second part of the exercise is basically that's what you should go do. You should be spending your life in pursuit of your genie goal. Maybe you can't start that tomorrow; you have financial obligations, maybe there's some experience you need. But at some point in this one life we get, you want to get yourself on that path of that journey. And that's the exercise that I go through with the students."

A lot of this is thanks to Farhan, who in our conversation shares very specifically what he's done to maintain intensity and urgency within the engineering team. Including their meeting cadences, the counter-intuitive power of pair programming, how they run meetings, how they cancel meetings constantly and so much more. He also shares his experience with indexing towards choosing the harder option when you have multiple options to choose from and why that ends up making your life easier.",

I'm of the opinion that any team, any app out there can introduce a streak, and if you figure it out, it probably works to retain users, but at the core, you have to have an app that people want to use, and people really like using Duolingo. It's fun, it's delightful, you learn something. And so, it allows us to layer an engagement mechanic on top of that the streak is really powerful. So, it ships a disgusting amount of DAUs, again, it is one of our golden geese. And again, what's cool is that, you look at notifications, notifications for Duolingo is massive. Us sending better, whether it's copy or timing, so many of our notifications work because they reference the streak, because users care about the streak.",

And I should actually put an asterisk around how many days in a row because we also have built flexibility into the feature. So, we have these things called streak freezes, it's like insurance for your streaks. So, it's a pretty simple feature, in theory, but over time we've layered on challenges, and goal setting, and rewards, and social features... A lot of our notifications are tied to the streak.

Especially with a focus on founder led sales, where founders are doing the early sales versus hiring salesperson. Which one, I know you're a huge advocate of and we'll talk about this. And two, you basically spent all your time working with founders and founding teams, helping them learn how to do sales, how to set up their go-to-market motions, how to scale teams, sales teams, how to hire sales people. So I'm very excited to have you here to create a very in the weeds, hands-on episode on how to do sales. How does that sound broadly?"

Some people might say zero to one, which is, how do I get my first million? Others might say, how do I go out and get my first 10 customers? It's all kind of in the same vein. And founder led sales is really, really, really important because in the very, very, very early days, when there is no brand equity, when there is no marketing engine running, when there is limited to no reference ability, the founder is the product, right? Because the product is still, could be abstract, could be an MVP or in it's really early formation. So the founder is the product. When people say, well, what does that even mean? It means that you are a subject matter expert on something highly specific.",

So you have this novel insight that you are building a business around. And it's that novel insight and the way you see the world that gets the market excited, in absence of a product. And that's actually happens even before you even show the product. So founder led sales is how do you bring the founders vision into the world and have the market, and understand what part of the market accepts it, and then what part of that vision are they accepting? So it's aligning the founders vision with the market reality."

If you're freestyle rapping, you have a beat, you don't have any lyrics, and you have to get into the beat and invent the lyrics and the melody and everything on the fly. So there's no choice but being completely present. What happens is you can see their brain and it's lit up in a very specific place that shows that they're in flow, and when they get to the very end, the brain just blows up. Before they finish, they start getting pulled out of flow. And this is the same feeling of you're running at school and you see the finish line and just a few yards before you start slowing down.

But the thing is, because there's so much self-consciousness that goes with speaking, we often feel kind of constraints under the layers of overthinking and anxiety that come with speaking. So it can be hard to realize that underneath these layers, you actually have this extraordinary superpower, because as humans we're evolved to speak, this is what we are. So you don't need to teach a baby how to speak, it will learn by itself with no formal education. So what that means is, we all have this incredible hardware.",

        "text": "The thing is, over the course of our life, because of all these little situations that happen, we start getting bugs in the software and we're not really upgrading our software. The moment you get the bugs and things start working, not working, we start avoiding, and suddenly it's like we're not upgrading our software anymore. So we're stuck on old, buggy software. But the reality is, let's not forget that we have incredible software that were evolved for this. So all we need to do is some debugging and some upgrading of the software and suddenly your entire life can change. So that's really one I want to impart on anybody listening. You have it in, you already have what it takes."

        "speaker": "Then I take the same person with the same skill set and the same ability and I bring them in a business setting, and suddenly I don't feel like myself anymore. And because of the pressure, I start trying to speak differently. So people start having, I'm going to try to think really hard of what I need to say and I want to control the words that are going to come out of my mouth before they come out of my mouth so I make sure I don't make a mistake. And you basically loop in this thing that is so counter what communication is, which is just a natural subconscious scale. So using speaking as a barometer of, hey, if this is not feeling good, I'm probably overthinking. I probably need to relax and try to just feel a little bit more like myself.",

        "text": "But this also applies to practice, where in your practice, because this is not an overnight thing, you can't just snap your fingers, read a book, and be a better speaker. Well, your practice has to be enjoyable as well because otherwise two weeks in, you're going to quit just like a shitty fitness journey or diet. Right? You have to find joy in it and it has to be structured in a way where it rewards you as well, so that you get more energy and you get more enjoyment while you do it."

So before that, and also I want to get into actual tactics that we can just give people to become better public speakers. But right before we get there, are there any other core insights or principles or lessons that are fundamental to the way you found that it works to become a better public speaker, that kind of inform a lot of the stuff we're going to be talking about?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "And one of the ways that changed how I practiced was, instead of focusing on the symptoms of speaking, I started to try and figure out, well, what are the root causes that create these symptoms, and can I address those? So instead of counting my filler words, if that's something that's annoying to me, I'm going to go back and try to figure out, well, what's the root cause of that? Well, the root cause of having lots of filler words or racing in your speaking, is that you probably struggle to feel comfortable slowing down, relaxing, or even pausing when your mind is racing and you feel pressure. Solve that, and not only do the filler words take care of themselves, but the racing takes care of itself and you suddenly have more mind space.",
        "timestamp": "00:14:11",
        "text": "And if you feel super constrained in your speaking, very monotonous, then maybe you feel boxed in and you're struggling to allow yourself to feel to be all of what you are under pressure because there's probably a lack of certainty. A lack of trust in, hey, if I let myself be more intense or if I let some of these emotions pop out, or if I take a time to gather my thoughts, is everything going to unravel, or is that going to work for me? And if you haven't proven that to yourself, then you're just going to go for safety and so you're going to be very monotonous and constrained, and that's creates monotony. But if I can solve that, suddenly I have freedom. So thinking through this and understanding that the goal here is upgrading the software and it's really layering, taking all the bad habits away and putting in new habits that I can just stay in this flow state without getting pulled out, that really changes the game."

Especially product managers are very ambitious and they want to get to the next level and they're always eyeing the next job, but you're not going to get the next job unless you do really well at the job that you're in. Knock it out of the park. However simple, however easy it may be to you, do a great job. And in tech jobs, there's table stakes. There's table stakes of you need to be technical, you need to know the latest technology, you need to understand your product, the product you're working on. No matter what your role is. You have to understand it deeply. You need to understand metrics. So especially product managers have a wide breadth of things that they need to understand. So those are a given. You need to do that."

        "speaker": "So now the question is the difference in leadership and executive roles and when you're getting there. So how do you start transitioning? So after you've done a great job at everything and you understand the core skills that you need, another thing you really need to know is understanding people and motivations. And when you're building products, you have to understand why does somebody want to use your product? What problem are they solving? Why do they want to click on that button? What's going to make them feel good when they click on it? What's going to give them delight and what's also going to make them feel bad and frustrated and what do they not want to do? So you need to understand motivations in people for building products and for building teams and organizations. So just like why does somebody want to click on a button, why does somebody want to join your team? Why do they want to work hard? What are they trying to accomplish? What's the goal for their career?",

And I'll say one thing that really helped me, this is a strange segue, but my father was a psychiatrist and when I was growing up, we would have family occasions, go to events, whatever, and afterwards in the car ride back, he would always give his perspective of analyzing what happened at the event. What this person was thinking. Why did they say this? And then he would quiz me of, \"Why do you think they did that?\" And it was really interesting because it taught me to see the whole room. To see how people react. Like Lenny, if you say something and somebody else is there, look at the other person. What's their face saying? You can understand so much if you're paying attention. So I think when you want to build for people and lead organizations, it is about the people and understanding them and motivating them."

        "text": "One of the things that I caution product managers about is that you don't want to be too overly reliant on metrics and you want to also have an intuition. You want product managers who understand intuitively their customers and their product and sometimes you'll make decisions because you just know it's the right thing to do because it feels right and it usually is right if you understand your product well enough. How do you get good at it? Ask a lot of questions. Don't assume you know. Marc Benioff would always say, \"Have a beginner's mind. Go in assuming that you know nothing and listen to your customers, listen to the people.\" Because I also see this as you're building a feature and you think it's the best thing. Because of course everyone's going to want it because you worked on it and you're going to put it front and center in the interface where everybody's going to see it. Well, no, you got to earn that right. And that is another thing that people do is they want the thing they worked on to be right there, but it might not be the most important thing that a person needs at that point. So have perspective. Have perspective of what your users are actually trying to achieve."

And they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites. And they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/LENNY and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/LENNY. And the idea is that if you, 40% or more of people, say they'd be very disappointed if they can no longer use the product, you essentially have product market fit."

It's our job to translate the complexity of the brain into really simple, straightforward systems that you can remember.

Where we're stuck largely is most people rely on their history department way too much. That's because the brain is actually built to conserve energy, and that's the lowest energy form of generating an answer to a question that the brain can pull off. If you instead send things to the more experimental, open-minded science department, the more creative art department, the humanities department of your compassion, et cetera, you get totally different answers.

I actually posted on Twitter for people to suggest questions for this topic and there's just so much interest in what we're going to be talking about, which essentially we're going to be diving deep into all things paid growth, all things performance marketing. By the way, I have a cold. For people, if in case you wonder why I sound a little weird, but the show must go on. I want to start with just setting a little context for folks that aren't super familiar with performance marketing and paid growth. When we talk about performance marketing/paid growth, first of all, are those two terms interchangeable to you? And second of all, what falls under the umbrella of performance marketing/paid growth?"

Typically, when I talk about performance marketing, it's about online only, but you could argue offline could be performing and affiliates could be performing and stuff like that. They can be interchangeable, but I would recommend if you are talking about it, to specify which one you're talking about. Because when you do say paid, because I'm in the industry, I would just, \"Oh, they do Google Search and they do Meta and they do things like that.\" But if you do offline and you just say paid, we may be talking about things, but missing each other on two ships passing in the night. So I think historically, people, when they have said paid growth, have been fully focused on just online."

If you look at the way each platform is doing, Google introducing AI, plus with paid taking up the first four spots, you have to scroll pretty far down to get to an organic listing. Meta, it's almost a pay for play now. You have to do promoted posts for people to even see your content. I would say it does depend on the industry you're in. If you're say, leaning heavily into influencer marketing, that is still a paid component. You may not be doing Meta ads, you may not be doing paid search, but that is a paid component. But I would say at baseline, everyone should be doing paid search. The way I usually explain it to people is paid search is user driven. You have to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show.",

You're watching a YouTube video, maybe a YouTube podcast, and then in between, you get advertisements maybe for Shopify, maybe for Pinterest, maybe for Eventbrite. So all of that being disruptive media may not make a whole lot of sense for where you are as a business, but I would say paid search being user-driven, having to type in a relevant keyword for your ad to show, should pretty much be for just about everybody."

I think there are analytics teams at other companies where they are answering people's questions, maybe even through Jira tickets, we're building dashboards. That was never really of interest to me.

I think the second thing which may be a little more contrarian is I think there are people out there who think that analytics should be embedded into business units. I strongly disagree. I believe a central model, a center of excellence is superior and I'm happy to talk about why, but that's something that I feel quite strongly about. We've tried it or I shouldn't... well, we've experimented in the past with the alternative, so putting it into a business unit and it's just much more problematic and I think the value you get from a central model is far greater than some of the things that you might lose."

You're embedded within the function, so you're a part of the team. That ownership, that camaraderie that comes with that, I think you can solve for that. But I do understand that that is a benefit. I think the other benefit of course is the business leaders control the roadmaps so they get to dictate the work. They know that they have help and resources in that area when they need them. So that certainty, that control, I totally understand the value there, but I think that those are two things that you can solve for if you know that those are the biggest issues with a central team. So for us, we have a central analytics team, but we are divided up into pods that map perfectly with how product engineering, operations marketing are structured as well.",
        "timestamp": "00:08:33",
        "text": "And so our team de facto has these folks embedded with our partner teams, even though the reporting structure is up through a central org through me. And that helps the team to feel like they are one team, both in terms of the analytics team feeling like it's one team, but also to use the marketing example, the marketing folks are one team and because the analytics shares the same goals as the marketing leaders, your incentives are aligned to work on the most important things and your success is their success and vice versa. So I think that that's been really a happy medium, but still preserves all the benefits of a central org. And there are a lot of them."

I want to be in the class that I'm potentially the worst at.\" This isn't how most people think. This isn't how most people operate. Usually people want to get good grades, they want to be at the top of their class. Clearly you have a different approach and a different mindset.

In 1500s we thought something and then the 1600s we thought something very different. And so this class was quite impactful on me where we spent an entire year studying things that are not true. It was fascinating. That particular teacher employed another trick on us during that class, which was it took the tuition fee of our school and divided it by the number of hours and wrote the cost on a ticket and then handed us in the beginning of the year. Tickets for every single one of the classes and he would stand at the door and you would have to give him a ticket at the end of the class that he thought it was worth it. And just like that practice of deep intellectual understanding of how people evaluated something at the time and choosing for yourself to spend the time on it by just the physical act of handing that ticket to the teacher.",

I was a bit unprepared and I remember actually taking a microeconomics class that was quite advanced and had a close friend and we studied exactly the same information. We sat and looked at the same cheat sheets, we practiced the same quizzes, we read the same books, and he got the top grade in the class and I got the bottom and that's from where that quote came from where the professor said, I think you should bump, potentially bump down. I was like, \"I already know that stuff. I'm interested in this topic. I'm going to try to improve, but look just because I'm significantly worse than the other kids in the class that has little to do with if I should leave.\" And he was particularly cool with it."

English was my selected major in school, but then I kept playing with computers and I kept liking math and I looked at the roles of the backgrounds of the people who were running the types of companies I loved. At the time Facebook was getting super phenomenally successful. Apple was already on their up and up again and everyone who was leading those places had technical backgrounds and I liked computers a lot, so I added computer science as an engineering degree midway through school. So I had to take the real science classes with the pre-med kids and the rest of it, and I did similarly poorly, but I did end up with a computer science degree and a liberal arts degree. So it was a journey, but I had to make a pretty big switch in the middle to get on that path."

We will do the work the night before it's due, so let's just make it due tomorrow. Can we turn tomorrow into today? So just optimistically seeing if we can just inject energy to go, go, go has produced surprising results and I think it ignites in other people that same interest and then it feeds off each other. And that's I think really in my bones from growing up. And then I added over time, had to learn this longer term, compounding, more strategic mindset where some of the things we want to accomplish, be it at my startups in the past or at Stripe, they can't be solved in an afternoon.",

Let's make some mistakes, let's try it out.\" With, \"Where are we going? What needs to be true over time? Where can we always invest? What will we never regret spending time in?\" We'll never regret spending time making the latency of our payments APIs at Stripe faster. We'll never regret making it more reliable to send 83B election mails to the IRS. Like we'll never regret those things. So let's just always compound those capabilities over time. Then the trick is how do you mix this go, go, go attitude with a long-term compounding? That's something I still struggle with, but I try to purposely balance it more than I used to."

You've seen a lot of this happening at Atlassian, you've been there for over 10 years at this point, and Atlassian has, I don't know, over a dozen different product lines at this point, something like that. I know a lot of people come to you asking for advice on how to build zero to one within a large company.

Initially, I joined to start the cloud developer ecosystem so developers can build apps on top of the Atlassian platform and sell them on the Atlassian marketplace. I worked on HipChat and Stride. HipChat was well-known, Stride less so. We were trying to win the enterprise communications market before Slack and Microsoft Teams came about. I did lead a business case to invest more in IT operations, got nowhere with it than we acquired Statuspage, Opsgenie, and something I tried to do with didn't quite get off the ground. More recently I started Jira Project Discovery, which was part of our internal incubator for two to three years, and came out of the incubator and generally available a year ago.",

That one worked, but it was hard and all the ones that I worked on before were really hard to, and that's the kind of stuff that really bothered me for a super long time. The good thing is working on a product for product managers, I got to talk to a lot of product managers and across all sorts of industries in the past three to four years, and I realize that 50/50 is actually not that bad."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Yeah, so on the opportunity side, so Atlassian, 300,000 customers. We play in a whole bunch of different markets, everything in the collaboration space. We have a lot of markets that we play in, which means that we've got a lot of competitors. But basically when we look at the areas we could go in, there's an endless list of areas that we could go in, play and have a decent chance to win. Much harder to do if you're a startup. The breadth that we've got makes it easier to try find areas where we could expand into. We're not starving like a smaller company, so we can actually afford to try to play somewhere, to do some bets, to have some of them fail and some of them succeed, so that's amazing. Now our customers, I said 300,000. The thing that I admire the most about the Atlassian business model is it's very broad. It's across small and medium-sized companies. We have startups using our products, and we've got also enterprises and very large enterprises using the same products, which means that there's a lot of areas where we could find a niche and go after it and expand progressively into all these areas so there's a massive distribution potential that comes with that. When I worked on Jira Product Discovery, I didn't start with, okay, I'm going to need to start finding product managers and it's going to be how to find them. No, they were already all using Jira. Atlassian is a company that has a relatively deep organization hierarchy but relatively flat decision making. So it's more like a, imagine a network of key decision makers across the organization. It doesn't really matter the job title or whether you are a manager of people or not. The decisions are made by people who drive change.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:02",
        "text": "So there's a lot of empowerment that comes from that, but also it's a mix of top-down, bottom-up happiness I'd say. And so it can feel really chaotic at first, but once you know how to navigate it, it's actually pretty easy to try to go after something that you care about. And of course, we're a big company, so there's lots of ways we can get help. Corporate development, research analysts that we can talk to whenever we want to explore something, thousands of customers that I just have to put something in the addressable community group and get hundreds of people applying to talk to me from one day to the next. So that's amazing, any startup would want that."

Jeffrey is a Professor of Organizational Behavior at Stanford's graduate School of Business, and teaches one of the two most popular and oversubscribed courses in all of the MBA program, called the Paths to Power. The other class, by the way, is Touchy-Feely, which we dove into last month. In his class and in his recent book, the Seven Rules of Power, Jeffrey teaches the things that you can do in your life and in your work to build your power, and through that get things done and advance in your career. As one student described the class, it's the cod liver oil of the Graduate School of Business. You know it's good for you, but you feel a little nervous about it. In our conversation, we dig into each of the seven powers, why it's important to build these skills even if you feel uncomfortable.",

We end the conversation with what you can start doing today to start building your own power. This podcast is basically for anyone that wants to advance in their career, whether you're an IC or a CEO, and I'm really excited to bring it to you.

They bear almost no resemblance to how we think the world ought to be. They bear a little resemblance to our aspirations. And I think we look around the world and we see people who have acquired enormous amounts of power and have used it for bad. But I tell people, I see people with hammers hitting other people on the head. That does not mean that a hammer is not a useful tool. You can take a screwdriver and stab it into somebody's belly. I have a very dear friend who we'll probably talk about later in the podcast. Laura Esserman is a breast cancer surgeon, and I tell people, Laura has a knife. She uses it to cure cancer. Muggers have knives. They use it to rob people. So I think we've confused the tool for how it has been used."

One I asked about the course of the impact it had on her. She's actually a founder now. And she told me that your class was her single most favorite class at all of Stanford Business School, because it was realistic and applicable to life as a founder. Because it didn't sugarcoat business, didn't sugarcoat life. It told her how the world really works and it is helping her succeed with her startup right now."

You make sure that you take techniques from all over the place, from Procter and Gamble, to Google, to you name it, of maybe you can't ask the customer to tell you what massive new innovation they would love.

I was sitting here in Silicon Valley for well over a decade, I landed in Sao Paulo when I first joined Newbank. And the small product team at the time is telling me about this thing called Sean Ellis score. And we recently had Sean visit us in Sao Paulo and talk to all of the product managers and designers.

I don't believe we have product market fit unless 50% of Brazilians are telling us they would be very disappointed, because Brazilians are inherently polite.

That's not necessarily what you need to obsess over, which is actually what I recommend to people is just find ways to have impact. So this is really interesting. Your advice is early in your career, focus on just getting stuff out and done. Don't so obsess with the impact. Can you talk more about just what, when you say output, what are you describing there? Is it just ship products and be helpful and produce something?"

For instance, if you are sourcing content for your homepage, what are the different avenues that you can source content from? What is the easiest to source? What is the most difficult to source? Just ranking it all in that order goes a long way. And one of the product managers actually did that yesterday and I went, wow, it just made my life so much simpler. And not just my life but so many other people's lives so much simpler, and we were able to take that specific output and use it as part of our overall strategy. If that PM would have obsessed about the overall content strategy, overall how we are going to do it versus just how we are going to be sourcing it, they would have indexed on something bigger and maybe would have not even been able to make that impact. But now, they were able to show something which was a small part, which was an output, but it fell into the overall outcome."

People just want you to get stuff done when you're just starting out. It's not like help us define our strategy and vision for the next three years. We just have stuff we need done. Can you help us get it done? Well, yes. And then essentially the advice is as you get more senior, you'll have more opportunity to think about strategy and what to build versus just how to build it and actually execute on it."

My product area ended up being the center and focus of the organization, yet the product manager who was chosen to lead the area when it became big wasn't me. It was someone else. At that time, I really felt very bad that okay, why did that happen? But now when I look back, I can see why that happened because that product manager was so much better at the overall craft of output, yet when they were focusing on outcome, we're not forgetting the output as well. So they were just better at me on launching products, they were better at me on working with design, in producing design artwork, and they were definitely better than me in running the experiments as well."

And so in observing their reactions and that dialogue, I could see that there was something going on that was meaningful to them. And this second book we're working on, we'll tease out why that's so more, but the answer to your question is when should you thinking about this? The answer is always. And that's an odd answer. And so even before you have product-market fit, it's worth thinking about strategy. Now it's not strategy in the sense of this fully articulated strategic planning, we're going to do this, these are going to be the competitors, this is how we're going to answer them. This is how we'll price. Not like that at all. At the earlier stage, you can imagine wildly more degrees of freedom and the questions are of the business propositions that you're thinking of in trying to get to product-market fit, what are the underlying characteristics that might tilt them towards the availability of power or not?",

And then later on, once you've already have product-market fit, then you have to understand your source of power to understand what competitive position is because then you have to establish that. And then later on in a more stable phase when you're in a stability phase of business, you have to know what your source of power is if you have one, because you have to know how to defend it. And then also it is also the foundational knowledge that you need for if there's another step. Because another thing that's quite surprising about iconic businesses is they often have a second act or a third act or fourth act. I mean think of AWS or Intel going into CPUs or Apple going into iPhones, all not the origin of business. And that's actually common, not unusual, and that's starting the process all over again."

There's affiliate marketing, which is this whole world of paid, where you're getting product reviews and that sort of thing, and that's not really an area that I'm an expert on, but we do work with some consumer companies where press is a major driver of growth. So for instance, Perplexity, they have invested essentially zero in any paid marketing, they don't have a marketing person even, but they do do PR. And so essentially, after their most recent announcement, they saw a massive spike in growth, a massive spike in signups, pro users, all of that. And I think, in that case, the reason PR works so well is...",

The barrier to trying the product is very low, you can quickly type in a query, get the answer, and then see the power of the tool. It takes one time to see the power of the tool. So in that case, I think just organic press is enough to generate that. There's not a long process to get the customers interested, so... Yeah.

Maybe they're not going to read eight paragraphs that you wrote about your business, but if it's in the format of an article, I think they're more likely to take the time to do it. One other, I guess, aspect of it is content. So for instance, the articles that people want to write about you are not about necessarily how great your podcast is, which it is, but more about how you created this business. And so it's more through the lens of you're an entrepreneur, you have built this media empire, and so that's not necessarily the kind of story that's going to drive your core audience to sign up, and so contents is part of it, too. And so we work with companies where we get them great stories about their company culture and cool initiatives that they're doing, because reporters are interested in that topic. That's not going to help their sales, but it might help with something like recruiting. And so yeah, I think thinking... That's the other piece of it, is thinking through the content."

And then you're saying B2C, most of the benefit is actually driving growth and you've seen lots of examples of press driving significant growth."

I'd hear, \"Oh, the head of engineering is such a jerk,\" or, \"This person won't listen to me,\" or, \"My team is demotivated. And I get it, but they need to step up and work more.\" And there was just a lot of conflict going on here and there that storytelling wouldn't fix. When that happens, and I talk about this in the book a bunch, no one wants to hear your stories. You have to actually be able to connect with people and to work with people and feel good as a leader in order to really step up and lead.

Instead of helping them figure out the story of the product, it's the story of the person. And so transitioning into the meat of your approach to coaching, I think you call it story-driven leadership. Essentially, your finding is that story and the person's story is extremely important and powerful in helping them level up as a leader and also seeing them as the hero of their story. I guess just with that foundation, can you just talk about why that is so powerful, the idea of figuring out your own story and why you need to be the hero of your own story and just what all this means?"

It happens, but that's not most of life. And there are other elements that I ended up uncovering when I looked deeper into what makes the most effective leaders effective, and the biggest thing is stories that we tell people, it's like the tip of the iceberg. And if anything, it even doesn't matter, I've worked with a lot of folks who their teams say, \"Stop it with the storytelling. Stop talking at us.\" And they don't want any of that.",

And they may or may not be true, they're usually not true, but our brain doesn't know the difference. It's the most powerful ability our brain has is to understand and see stories everywhere. And so once you can really understand that, you may as well leverage it to be that hero in your life. And even as I say it out loud, it sounds so cheesy, but it's true. This is neuroscience and psychology. We just want to be the heroes, and that's what our focus is."

A big part of my role is, can I explain how we're going to approach those technical problems in a way that builds competence with the content team?

So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes. And that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days.

It's a stark difference from traditional banking options that leave a startup's cash sitting idle while chipping away at it with fees. To help founders protect cash and extend runway, Brex combined the best things about checking, Treasury, and FDIC insurance in one powerhouse account. You can send and receive money worldwide at lightning speed, you can get 20x the standard FDIC protection through program banks, and you can earn industry-leading yield from your first dollar while still being able to access your funds anytime.

And we're going to run experiments. And again, the Design Sprint, highly scripted, calendar clear, emails off, Slack is off.

And the reason, the mechanism behind all that logic, is that pragmatic people buy what they see their peers are buying. So if peer one is buying product A, and peer two is B and C and D, there's no market leader, and the category goes sideways. But if A, B and C, if three out of four people are using the iPhone, it's like, \"Oh, I guess I'm supposed to get an iPhone,\" that kind of thing."

What I'm imagining when you do this is many people disagree. There's teams people want to join, there's teams people don't want to join. It seems like there's a consensus challenge where do you wait for everyone to agree? Does someone end up making a decision? Does it distract everyone from the work they're doing when you're kind of involving everyone in the reorg? Versus what typically happens, it secretly is planned amongst executives. No one knows it's coming. And I think the reason they do that is because they don't want to distract anyone and they don't want anyone to start freaking out until it's like, \"Here's the final plan. Here's what we're doing.\" So what other advice do you have for people that want to practice this way of reteaming and reorging where they involve the actual team in the plan?"

And so I think we're actually seeing a bit of a shift where we can actually hold them accountable, which means we can put them in senior roles, which means the engineers can actually get what they've been trying to get the entire time, but we haven't been able to because we've been coddling them a little bit too much."

That building had a different key card. If you didn't work on Google+, you could not get in. All sorts of counter-cultural things at the time. And as a result, there was a lot of antagonism internally for Google+. And so when I left in the middle of the project, leaving with all of the plans in my head to the enemy, some people saw me as a traitor, understandably. Other people thought I was enlightened. It depends on who you talked to, but it was the right thing for me to do. But at the time it was a hard thing to do."

One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey.

It's always this like, \"You need to get better at crafting a vision, telling your story.\" It's also this very powerful tool. The product managers have to align teams to be more successful in the products they're building.

So it needs to be something that feels... It almost scares you in an exciting way, right? Like, oh, my God, this is something I can get up every morning. And if we did that, goddamn. But at the same time, it needs to be realistic and attainable, so it cannot feel so pie in the sky that it feels so out of reach, right? And of course, there are leaders and people who have really, really big visions and they see beyond the rest of us, but that's not most people. Most people, it needs to feel within reach.",

Or I've come back to tell you what we need to put in place now so that we will get there, right?\" And so you have this kind of three components and if those come together and they are grounded of course, in a problem that people are excited about, you've got your vision. And how that vision manifests really depends on what you want to do. There're simple ones you can do, they're big ones you can do. But those are the core pieces in my mind."

The vision was a world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking. Because cities, 25% of the average city is parking spaces. You're in San Francisco, you'll see buildings, just floors just for parking, right? You'll have basements just for parking. In a world where we have housing problems, we have ridiculous prices for rents. Just imagine if you could free up all of those spaces for all kinds of things, right? Homes, restaurants, you name it. Parties, warehouse parties especially, they have the best. That was the vision. You could kind of see it, right? You're like, \"Oh, I could see a world.\" I mean, I live in Amsterdam, I have a bicycle, I can see it every other day. They're getting rid of cars and actually converting the parking lots on the street into communal gardens, right?",

And that's how things like Uber Pool came in where in a world where the average car has 1.5 people in it, we can maximize that and then we can get this connected trip where the car is just moving and then maybe the car is autonomous, so you don't actually have to drive that car, and so it just doesn't need to stop. I guess, it needs to charge at some point. But so that's it. I think that's a really good vision. I think one that's lofty and I dance between whether it's attainable or not, is Elon Musk saying, \"We're going to get to Mars.\" He believes it. He believes it so much that sometimes I'm like, \"I guess, we're going to Mars.\" But then there was the other one of, oh, we want a car that's electric and we want that car to be beautiful so that we will get to a car that's accessible to everyone. And that's kind of followed through. So yeah, I mean, the beautiful things about visions is that it helps you decide it. Is that a work... Do I care about this problem? Is it something I want to do? And then you can take it or leave it."

And basically every year since it came out, I keep thinking, \"All right, that's the end. Surely that's enough.\" And just each year it gets crazier and crazier, and new things come my way. So, I'm building the Long-Term Stock Exchange, LTSE, I'm sure we'll talk about, and I spend a lot of time still with founders and with big company execs trying to answer their questions about how to build companies in the right way.",

So because of my work on governance, I wound up meeting with and getting to work with some of the top AI companies, so that's been really interesting, but I feel like I go where the issues that are on people's minds go, and it kind of pulls me into new and really interesting things all the time."

So, that's the other thing I think people don't appreciate. People call me a first principles thinker, which I love that, it's a big compliment, but I feel like it conjures up for people this idea that I sit in a cave for years and years and conjure up the magic idea. It's like, no, I wish people had all the outtakes of all the concepts I've tried. Lean Startup was not my first try, the conceptual vocabulary. It's not the first time I got it right. It came through a lot of trial and error, a lot of trying to figure out what works and doesn't work, first in my own career, in my own work, then trying to give advice to other people and trying to translate what worked for me to see what would work for them, and then to answer the questions that I thought were the natural ones.",

And then the bigger picture thing is, what are we really doing here? What does success even look like? That, I think, is the thing we all really grapple with is it's very easy to come up with a theory or a method or a process that produces the maximum of something, but then it's like, \"Is that thing good? Is that actually helping us accomplish some kind of goal?\" And so, I think that first principles thinking is very helpful for that too, but I don't know. I guess to really answer your question, the true answer is I don't know. I've just always felt like I was wired that way. I have a love of ideas and want to know why things work."

It's been stuck for so long. And what I kept hearing, \"You guys, did you hear about Rosetta Stone? This solution already exists.\" So I think that there are a couple of things that really made Duolingo's success, which are very hard to replicate.",

        "text": "Number one, an obsession for the mission. That sounds cliche. I think a lot of founders and startup people like to talk about the mission, and I get it, and I think it's real. But I really mean it, because this obsession for solving a problem for hundreds of millions of people, and the problem wasn't just a vitamin. It was a problem in the sense that if you don't know English in today's world, your opportunities to get out of your socioeconomic zone are very diminished. More specifically, you can double or triple your income potential by learning English in a developing market like Latin America. And there are lots of those around the world. That belief that education should be free and that people should have access to that opportunity, not just in developing countries, but of course, also in the US really drove the organization in a way that drove how we built our marketing, how we spoke to our users, how we designed the experience, how we put barriers in front of taking decisions that would actually impact that mission. It helped our users rally around the business. It helped us hire the best people even if we were based in Pittsburgh and couldn't necessarily pay the Google dollars. So it's really hard to measure the importance of just really being obsessed about that mission. But I speak to a lot of education founders, ed tech founders, and I am very biased probably because of this experience. I will say that I had one of those, what's it called, the experiment where they looked at all of the shots that some plane got when it came back from war and then started fixing the plane. There's a name for this. And then they realized that-"

So what's your advice to founders for when raising money makes sense? I actually wrote this article, one's called, Your Startup Is Probably Not Venture-Scale, just trying to convince people, you may have a really good idea, but it doesn't mean it's a venture-scale business.

They can't sell it for too much because the other place down the street sells it for less.

Most of them are usually a couple of weeks, but they have a maximum of six weeks. So we don't get stuck in these big huge projects, with meetings with 18 people, and slow decision-making, and indecision, and complexity, and all the things that come with trying to do too many things for too many people. Now, all that said, we could still make the mistake of hiring hundreds of people because we could afford to do so. But to spend money because you have it on things you don't need is something that Silicon Valley's gotten quite good at, but we're quite bad at intentionally.

Honestly, if you gave me 1,000 people, I wouldn't know what to do with them. We would fall apart. If you gave me 500 people, I wouldn't know what to do with them. We would fall apart. We would be a worse off company with 500 people. I'd be completely lost. So, that's the other thing. I don't even understand how they run, and the amount of layers they must need, and the amount of complexity organizationally that they must have to... The latticework they have to build up to support all that weight, is just remarkable and it's foreign to us."

So just not far from Google's headquarters there was WhatsApp, not very famous in the US but they actually created massive impact. Hundreds of millions of people were using their stuff and they became a threat to Facebook much more than Google was.

And so when you think about things like retention, you can absolutely test, course I'm not saying you can't, but you're looking at a different time horizon.

So for that reason and many other reasons, there's a lot of interest in just how Ramp operates and how you all approach product and we actually previously collaborated on a newsletter post on how Ramp builds product. And that newsletter post is now the eighth most popular post on my newsletter across hundreds of posts that are ever written and even more than how Figma builds product and how Snowflake builds product and all these other incredible companies. And so, clearly, there's a lot of interest in how you operate. So I'm really excited to get into the meat of how you all work. And if anyone read this post and has any sense of just how you all operate, there's this one word that immediately comes to mind when people think of how Ramp operates and that word is velocity. So I want to start there. Can you just talk about how important velocity is to how you work and where that came from and how that actually looks day to day working at Ramp?"

And so velocity was ingrained from the early days on just building, shipping, and iterating. And I think it's a decent metric for how companies and teams perform. You might say, \"Well, what's the impact of that velocity?\" But realistically, teams that have high velocity are able to actually get to that impact over time by iterating. It's also a great way to have positive selection in terms of talent because talent wants to join companies that ship fast. And a lot of people who join Ramp, I ask them, \"Why are you interested in joining the company?\" And they often say, \"Well, it's because you guys are actually building things and shipping things and I want to know what that feels like.\" And it's also a great way just de-risk decisions and decision making. If the cost of that decision is really low, then you're able to essentially simplify a lot of decisions."

Six months after that, we built a competitor to Expensify, both publicly traded companies. We hit a hundred million in annual revenue. I think we were under at that point 50 total in the R&D department, less than four engineers and three PMs. And then we started expanding into accounts payable. We basically gave a team goal of building a competitor, Bill.com. It was three engineers, one designer, one PM three months, and they hit out of the park. And that product is moving in billions of dollars a year.",
        "timestamp": "00:09:49",
        "text": "And I think the recipe for all this is constantly small teams have a single-threaded focus, give them the resources they need to execute big lofty goals, very tight timelines, and then shield them from the chaos that is the rest of the organization. So basically don't bother them and don't even tell the rest of the company that you're doing these things until they find product market fit, until they actually find that early traction and then they can bring in more resources.

The first is, as you make relationship connections across the way, that is a real way by which people get opportunity. They keep in touch with those people. They learn they might follow someone, and hopes in getting knowing them and getting that knowledge. We got to make sure that that content is getting to them.",

We've really, really been focused on driving those two systems. How does someone connect to opportunity both through the people and through the content that they actually want? As you know, when you do a feed, there's so many decisions that go into that complex system, so many decisions.

So whether it's content, community, small scale events, and then PR, after all of that is when you start paid and brand effort and then SEO probably start around the same time that you start paid marketing efforts. The reason for the progression the way I've described it is the channels get more expensive as you go farther along and they get more effective as you understand more about your customers."

The company's still very lean for the amount of growth. We're under 500 people roughly today at that scale and that's definitely have a much higher revenue per employee than some of our other competitors and others in the space. And yeah, I mean we've got a very thoughtful and smart finance team that I've worked with actually closely our old head of strategic finance at Instacart and they set ambitious goals for us on growth and I'm happy to say we've consistently beat those ambitious goals over the last 16 months or 18 months since I've joined."

And then after a while, the world switched from curation to recommendation, where instead of people doing that work, you had algorithms. And that was a big change that required us and others to actually rethink the entire user experience and sometimes the business model as well. And I think what we're entering now is we're going from your curation to recommendation to generation. And I suspect it will be as big of a shift that you will eventually have to rethink your products. We have to rethink the user interface and the experience for recommendation first era.

Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytic cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover."

I had sold the company to Yahoo in the mobile space. I worked there for a while. I came back to Sweden and then I met through a mutual friend, Daniel Ek, the CEO and co-founder of Spotify. And they had built the desktop product already, the free streaming desktop product, and it was amazing and I could try it, but they needed someone to figure out what to do with mobile. And because I had been an entrepreneur in that space, I got that job."

The performance wasn't there and also you couldn't fund that with an ads model. So it was a product and business model innovation that was a lot of fun. So that's how I started. Then after a few years, I took on all of product development for Spotify. And then a few years later, I actually took on the technology responsibility, the CTO role for Spotify as well. And recently, my official title is co-president of Spotify together with Alex Nordstrom. So we run half of the company each. I run the product and technology side and he runs for the business and content side. So that's the super fast version."

You can monetize that usage with sales, too. Why? Self-serve monetization has a cap of about $10,000. That's just how much we're able to process on the credit cards before they start getting flagged and declined by the banks and how much we as a consumers and prosumers are even willing to put on our credit card because not all credit cards have limits of over 10, 20, 30, $40,000.",

All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.",

        "text": "There's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, \"Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth.\" And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from."

Our product management team, our designers, our engineers are located across three different hubs in Europe. What that sort of leads to is a couple of practices that we have as part of our culture. The first one is practicing empathy to gain insights. It's not just practicing empathy in terms of customers and figuring out what customer pain points and problems we can solve, but given our distributed nature in terms of having a global footprint and a lot of our go to market teams, folks in sales and marketing and customer success are in different continents or geographies, we have to make sure that we actually practice that internally. When we are interacting with folks, let's say in San Francisco, and those folks are out there meeting some of our large customers and stuff, how do we, in the product organization, understand their perspective, and bring that perspective into how we design, prioritize and build products? I think that's one thing that's unique.",

I'll talk a little bit around how we are structured in the product organization so that it's a cross-functional perspective we bring to everything that we're doing because we believe the best work happens when we bring different diverse perspectives to the problem and then co-create the outcome that the customer is looking for."

They have a PLG motion, they have a sales team as well. PLG motion is perfect for lowering the barrier for more people to try, broader the reach. It's a kind of volume kind of game. And then the sales motion, you can have very targeted list of big customers you go after, you close them and it's a big order. Usually revenue, a very strong foundation for a company. And I've seen actually a lot of my clients that are doing, they have both. They're doing that. They try to get the benefit of both from their early stage and it's super cool."

Now there's great podcasts and blogs. There's great cohort-based courses like Reforge. But one of the things I found incredibly helpful in my career that really helped me level up was one-on-one coaching. There was nothing that could really replace the opportunity to have a conversation with someone who had the ability to ask the right questions, had the ability to help you see around corners, do the experiences that they had had.

They like the types of problems that they're working on, yet there's a whole other community of people who love to work earlier stage. It could be founders. It's also freelancers who like to help to build startups. It's investors and angels.

So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal? So in positioning work we call this competitive alternatives. Now, how people mess up this first step is, I say competitive alternatives and they think competition. So things that look exactly like me. But in B2B we kind of have two sets of competitors. We have status quo, which is whatever the company is doing to attempt to solve the problem right now, even if it's crappy and not great. And then there's, if the company does decide they're going to buy something different, they usually make a short list. So, it's whoever else lands on the short list. I need to be able to put a stake in the ground and say, I got to beat all that in order to win a deal."

And if we're not positioning well against that, we're never going to get the customer to come off of that. So I got to win against status quo, but I also have to win, most of the time, if it's B2B, you don't just buy the first thing you come across, you make a short list of alternatives and I got to win against those as well."

So feature function or even capabilities of the company, which could be pricing or professional services around other things that you've got, but also capabilities of the product. What have I got that the alternatives don't have? And I can make a giant list of these things.

So maybe just talk about a little bit of your background and then what you do now, the company that you run now."

I was really impressed with the way you're building and the way you're approaching it. Also, I don't have a lot of depth in sales, and so I loved this opportunity to learn about how sales works by participating. So thank you for letting me join the journey of Bravado.

But you had this great suggestion that we instead focus more specifically on what founders should change in the coming year knowing the conditions of the market and how things are turbulent and how people are spending less and things like that. So we're going to talk about five things that you can do right now to change the way your sales process works starting now for the next year. The idea is once you listen to this conversation, you can go and do these things immediately with your team. So that sound good?"

Let's say in Q1, if we hit 2.5, then we should revise up our targets for the rest of the year and we can unlock this additional budget to kind of spend off of. If we hit below 2, we should revise down our number. So kind of being comfortable with regularly reforecasting. Forecasting, you can't just forecast a quarter out every time. Obviously that's a tough way to run a business. So you got to forecast a year, but then set milestones, checkpoints and kind of make predetermined decisions that allow you to avoid the bias of then walking into Q1 and being like, \"Oh, we missed in Q1, but no, no, we're really going to hit it in Q2.\"",
        "timestamp": "00:18:29",
        "text": "You got to set the targets upfront because as founders, we tend to have a bias towards optimism. That's generally how founders operate. In today's market, that's more of a disadvantage than an advantage. So my suggestion is to really think about forecasting conservatively, setting up checkpoints and milestones around what future success may or may not look like. If you hit those goals, then decelerating or accelerating into it depending upon what you get there, and coming to an agreement with your board, with your sales team, with your sales leadership in advance so that there's no debate about what to do when you actually get there."

Tech is getting crushed, right? In COVID, everyone's getting crushed. So it didn't matter if you owned a yoga studio or gas pump or whatever, a hotel. There was nothing that was working well unless I guess you owned Amazon Fresh or something. There were very few businesses that were doing better as a result of COVID. But there's a bunch of companies that aren't doing that bad. I mean, if you listen to other podcasts, you've probably seen that tech is the one that is getting the most hammered in this, although I think in the last two weeks, crypto has caught up pretty quickly.",
        "timestamp": "00:20:47",
        "text": "But it's really kind of tech, right? So when you see a slowdown in tech that is disproportionate, you have to assume that it may last for a much longer period of time than you imagine. I think that given the lack of visibility and the amount of volatility, I think it is a unique situation for most companies, for most leaders. I think that the only response to which is to try to get really comfortable with being wrong and adding new data in in order to make decisions regularly without the fear of coming across as not knowing what you're doing."

So the way it works is that you enter your stats, and in doing so, you get global benchmarks of how you're doing versus other reps or other companies. So there's a premium for being accurate here because otherwise you don't actually get a real sense of how you're doing versus others. So there's an incentive structure that's built in to be really precise. Then that information feeds into our kind of global leaderboard where we are able to slice and dice and say, \"Okay, of companies that are headquartered in San Francisco, here's how your company's doing. Of sales reps that sell to CMOs, here's how you're doing. Of reps who carried a quota of between 500, 700K this quarter, here's how you rank.\" So we do global benchmarking for sales reps and sales teams and we share that information for free to anyone who is willing to participate in the ecosystem."

So there's so many things that we want them to be good at and to understand that and the complexity that the role actually brings with it. That's sometimes hard for people that have never worked as a product person to really understand. So, yeah, if I would need to pick two things, then that's maybe the two biggest differences."

Companies like Netlify and Tenfold and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by [inaudible 00:03:56]. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10x your experiment velocity."

Everybody understands now.\" It was a real moment for me. But the problem with funnels and pirate metrics and the favorites that I love to pick on are MQLs and SQLs is that nobody knows what those mean. It puts every customer in the same sort of buckets. It assumes that all customers and all products are the same. It puts businesses, or they, I should say, puts businesses at the center of the business versus putting customers at the center. It's about the values of the business, not the value to the customer that's being measured."

But primarily it was really about how do we, as people, communicate with each other, how do we express ourselves through creativity.

I mean, GitHub has more than a decade, nearly a decade and a half of history of bringing developers together to collaborate on code through repositories. But in the last few years, we've really expanded that portfolio to include so many different parts of the developer life cycle."

Also, I credit a lot of my getting started to both of them because they've been very generous with their time when I was just kind of considering advising, especially Casey, if they listen to this. Huge shine out to both of them, but Casey especially. He's such immense when it comes to just being generous with his time. So no, there is no competition, but had there been one, I suspect I'd be in lead right now because I've done it. I've done it in a shorter period of time. I'm much newer to advising than both of those, but no, I have a ton of aberration respect both of them. They're phenomenal what they do and I learned a ton from them."

And so, both of them have had a pretty significant influence in different ways, but both significant influence on who I am. When I grew up, I changed that a lot. I think when I was very young, one of my uncle is a doctor, so I saw him and I was like, \"Oh, maybe I should be a doctor.\" And at some point later, I changed that. In high school, I took French and I ended up being really good at it, surprisingly good at it, and I was very passionate about it.",

And maybe I'll teach French.\" That lasted for a few years and turned out that I ended up not pursuing that, and instead, got a degree in computer engineering. Partly, I think because in India back then, if you were good at science and mathematics, you would usually take up engineering. And so, that's what I ended up doing. I was also quite passionate about computers, so maybe that was part of it. But once I started on that path, it became much clearer what I wanted to do."

You don't have to just write code, but you can do a lot. And so, I also think it's a great place for people to start their career if they have a technical background and if they enjoy the part about building software. Because sometimes people will ask me, \"Hey, I'm doing this technical degree, whether it's computer science or something else, but I want my first job to be product management.\" And I often respond with, \"Tryout engineering because, again, in many companies, fortunately these days you can do a lot more than just the core engineering job.

How the loop works is someone can create a coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create OKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it. So they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about."

I know nothing about engineering.\" And so I was very imposter syndrome-y about it. And he gave me a little nudge, and was like, \"I think you'd be really good at it.\"",

So I left as a director of product. And for most of my time there, I worked on the seller side. So it was all seller tooling, working with sellers to figure out how they could grow and scale their businesses. And it was an awesome, wild ride. But that was my first role in product. And then I went on after that into several other product roles as well."

And the other part is actually influencing the live event experience that you will experience when you actually join an event or an experience.",

And that is another layer of complexity. And so that was super fun. I was there for about, I think, a little over two and a half years. Started as a PM. I think I got promoted a couple times. Left as senior product lead, I believe was my title. And forever grateful for that experience because I learned a ton about product market fit and also product quality."

So part of it is more of just the way Airbnb works is something that I think I use every day in my job, which is just truly thinking about product quality and the end consumer experience. And Airbnb does not ship product if it is not good. And even if they're trying new things, they are obsessed with the end consumer experience. And I learned so much from that line of thinking because just, if it shipped, it was really high quality. All the edge cases had been thought through. And the experience I had before that was definitely we were shipping things more quickly, things weren't always perfect. And it's not to say that everything Airbnb ships is perfect, but I think that obsession with the end consumer experience really influences the quality of their product suite and is something I try to bring to my job today because no one does it better, in my personal opinion."

You've worked with Brian Chesky, I'm sure he embodies that. Jack at Square, Tony at DoorDash, Larry at Google, all of these folks embody that mission. Mark at Facebook. That they care about winning.

So, basically take one step down at different company, which is at Coinbase, basically. I sat on the board of Coinbase, and I think that person still thanks me because I think they were focused too much on the title, that they were going to be the super senior person at this company on the management team, et cetera. But I said, \"Ultimately you don't realize this, but the value of working at a leader in any space, the quality of talent you work with, the brand, the network effect, so many things accrue to you.

I saw even if you're the VP of product at Yahoo or the head of product at Yahoo versus a ICPM at Google, you probably want to be the ICPM at Google. I bet you all day long, all day long. Yahoo is a great company, but Google is just a different caliber and different class. So I think it's very important to try to work at, obviously you don't know who the winner is, but if you think that's that something is a winner in a space, in large space, so many benefits that recruit from working at winners. You get unfair brand halo because you worked at a winner. People attribute a lot of the... \"Oh yeah, you worked at a winner. Hence, you must be a winner.\" Probably not the case, but you can...
