We don't know who the fifth greatest cubist artist is. Wherever you look in life, the people that we tend to admire the most are the people who broke and took new ground.

If you reframe the existing problem such that people see it in a different way, that's when they'll be open to a new solution. You can't take an existing problem with an existing solution, launch exactly the same shit, tell the world it's better and have the world embrace it.

    "Languaging is a strategic weapon: Creating new language (like Starbucks' 'grande latte' or OpenAI's 'large language model') changes how people think, creates demarcation points in value perception, and is how category queens differentiate.",
    "Backcast from the future instead of forecasting from the present: Legendary entrepreneurs reject the premise of the status quo, envision a radically different future, then work backwards to determine how to make it happen.",
    "Category design starts with word of mouth, not reach and frequency: Instead of peanut-butter spreading your marketing budget, use lightning strikes targeted at super consumers with a powerful category point of view that drives organic word of mouth."
