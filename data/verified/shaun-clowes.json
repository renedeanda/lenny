    "Data is a compass, not a GPS - being overly data-driven makes you slow or wrong, and when data contradicts strong intuition, the data is usually the thing that's flawed. The real skill is right-sizing data usage and seeking disconfirming evidence.",
    "B2B SaaS moats come from accumulated business rules and configuration, not UIs or data models - AI won't easily disrupt incumbents because the lock-in is in years of evolved workflows that even the companies themselves can't fully articulate without reading their own code.",
    "Treat your career like a bingo card by deliberately choosing roles that stretch you into unfamiliar domains - the compounding benefit of diverse experiences creates pattern-matching superpowers that make you dangerous in unexpected situations."
