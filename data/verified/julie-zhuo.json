    "Use the dimensionality framework for self-awareness - every human has infinite dimensions of strengths and weaknesses; feedback on one dimension doesn't threaten your identity, and every strength has a corresponding weakness",
    "Managers need genuine conviction not just orders - if you don't truly believe in what you're doing, you're just parroting and won't be effective at holding the vision; work through disagreements to find real belief or test assumptions"
