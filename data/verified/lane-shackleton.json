    "Great teams need a cathedral, not just bricks - PMs must show multiple facets of the vision (writeups, metrics, mocks, billboards) so every team member can see their contribution to the bigger picture.",
    "Stop debating and start making - the skippable ads lesson proves that running experiments with extreme variants produces conviction faster than months of discussion, and this applies from ICPMs to CPOs.",
    "Separate strategy from OKRs and keep planning under 10% of execution time - conflating strategy with goal-setting is a common trap, and over-planning steals time from the learning that only comes from shipping."
