    "Custom model development became essential despite not being the original plan - every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model, focused on complementing foundation model weaknesses rather than replacing them.",
    "In AI products, traditional moats matter less than sustained innovation velocity - the ceiling is so high that any entrenchment can be leapfrogged, requiring continuous improvement as the core strategy.",
    "Hire for level-headedness and internal motivation over credentials - people less focused on external validation who maintain composure through hype cycles are critical for building in fast-moving spaces."
