    "Product and operations teams function best as a twin turbine engine — they need mutual respect and a strong bidirectional feedback loop to maximize efficiency",
    "Product reviews should be safe spaces focused on making the product better, not firing squads — leaders should probe and suggest rather than mandate",
    "Jobs to be done is most valuable when you can't easily be your own customer, forcing deeper empathy and understanding of the full context around purchasing decisions",
    "When A/B testing isn't statistically viable, don't chase false precision — use alternative conviction-building techniques like customer interviews, observational data, or simply trust your intuition and ship",
    "Vertical integration is a genuine competitive moat — it requires excellence across pricing, product, operations, risk, and capital markets simultaneously, making it extremely hard to replicate"
