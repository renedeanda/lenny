    "The best logos are easy to use without a 500-page brand book; they should teach you how to use them by how they exist.",
    "Prevent creative burnout by switching between diverse projects rather than taking breaks — variety sustains motivation better than rest.",
    "Perfect typography requires making things imperfect — optical corrections break mathematical regularity to achieve perceived perfection."
