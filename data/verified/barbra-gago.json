    "Rebranding should be treated like a product development process with sprints, owners, and cross-functional involvement -- not a marketing team vanity project done in isolation.",
    "Opinionated software that enforces best practices through product constraints creates stronger differentiation and better outcomes than fully flexible tools that leave users to figure out processes on their own."
