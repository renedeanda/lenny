    "In the age of AI and vibe coding, building fast produces generic products trained on existing data -- teams that slow down to think deeply about differentiation before prototyping build more compelling products.",
    "Every successful product has a founding hypothesis at its core, but most teams leave it implicit and unwritten -- making it explicit allows teams to interrogate, test, and iterate on the variables that matter.",
    "Differentiation is the common pattern behind every breakthrough product from Gmail to Slack to ChatGPT -- not just having a good product, but having clarity about what makes it fundamentally different.",
    "Three to four weeks of sequential design sprints with real customer testing can compress three to four months of typical startup iteration -- speed comes from structured testing, not from building faster."
