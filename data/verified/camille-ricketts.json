    "Community-led growth works best for freemium products with an 'atomic unit of sharing' -- something users create that they want to show off because it reflects their identity or skill, like Notion templates or Figma designs.",
    "Don't make metrics the gatekeeper of community investment early on. Premature ROI demands can kill organic fervor. The most successful companies delayed monetization to protect enthusiasm and momentum.",
    "Start small and stay intimate. Notion's ambassador program began with just 20 vocal users. Controlled growth preserves the dense personal bonds that make communities feel like families rather than auditoriums.",
    "Content needs content-market fit just like products need product-market fit. Understand your audience's deepest anxieties and create painkiller content that addresses real professional pain, not vitamin content that's nice to have.",
    "Community takes many forms depending on your stage and market. Use a two-by-two matrix of product-market fit status and enterprise vs. consumer orientation to determine whether ambassadors, champions, customer advisory boards, or consultants are the right play."
