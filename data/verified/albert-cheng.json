And then when you're in exploitation mode, it's like focusing your resources on climbing that mountain effectively. If you do too much exploration, you can have your team feel a little bit too scattershot. And if you do too much in exploitation, it can lead to this saturation and stagnation where you're just locally maximizing a thing.",
