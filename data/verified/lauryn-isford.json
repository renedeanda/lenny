    "Onboarding should teach users what they need, not push premium features -- mapping onboarding to your pricing package prioritizes the company's interests over the customer's journey.",
    "Growth teams should be agile about their north star metric -- spending too long finding the perfect one wastes time that could be spent chasing the next big opportunity."
