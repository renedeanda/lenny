    "Respecting someone's no is paradoxically one of the most powerful forms of influence - taking their refusal at face value and acting accordingly often motivates them more than coercion.",
    "Fear-based motivation is unsustainable - the belief that 'my fear of not being good enough drives me to be great' is a trap; vision-based motivation produces better long-term results.",
    "Stay in integrity even when it's scary - the suffering from not asking for what you want (people-pleasing, silent resentment, imposter syndrome) is always worse than the discomfort of asking."
