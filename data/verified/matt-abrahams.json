    "Strive for connection over perfection by 'daring to be dull' -- lowering self-evaluation pressure frees cognitive bandwidth to actually communicate better.",

    "Reframe anxiety as excitement -- the physiological response is identical, and relabeling it positively causes you to relax and communicate better.",
    "Be interested, not interesting in conversations -- small talk is like hacky sack, not volleyball; set others up and match disclosure levels.",
    "Treat feedback as collaborative problem-solving, not judgment delivery -- use structures like the 4 I's (Information, Impact, Invitation, Implications) to package difficult conversations."
