  "takeaways": [
    "Product ops is both a system you create AND a role — the distinction matters because sometimes you need processes and tools, not necessarily another person",
    "The core thing a PM should never give up is spending time with customers and watching their pain — product ops exists to free PMs to focus on this, not replace it",
    "Ops teams are not a sign of inefficiency but of growth — they emerge naturally as functions mature, helping maintain alignment across rapidly scaling organizations",
    "Product ops should build systems and then get out of the way — the goal is to automate repeatable work and evolve into a strategic advisory role, not become permanent process managers",
    "Bringing engineers into customer meetings is a simple yet transformative change that shifts planning dynamics and gives engineering voices more weight in the product development lifecycle"
