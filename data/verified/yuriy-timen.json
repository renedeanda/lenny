    "The worst growth mistake isn't a channel failing -- it's prematurely concluding a channel doesn't work because you never gave it a proper shot with sufficient creative angles and volume.",
    "Healthy freemium conversion benchmarks matter: 20-35% visitor-to-free-signup, and north of 5% free-to-paid conversion is the minimum threshold for a sustainable subscription business.",
    "Customer research always pays off. The clarity and momentum it creates in early-stage companies by galvanizing the team around real user insights is consistently one of the highest-ROI investments."
