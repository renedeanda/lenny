    "Customer discovery dies from friction - automate conversations onto your team's calendars by default rather than asking individuals to do it, and distinguish between targeted discovery and continuous customer listening from existing signals.",
    "Forest time is essential for product leaders - take one day per month to elevate above the trees, survey the landscape, and recalibrate your aim before spending millions of dollars on execution."
