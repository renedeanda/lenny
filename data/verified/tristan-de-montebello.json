And the reason it's so transformative is because speaking is not a specialized skill, it's a meta skill. That means that the better you get at speaking, the better your life gets.",

But the reality is, we have incredible software that we're evolved for this. So all we need to do is some debugging and some upgrading.",

I'm completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey. And the goal is to get into a flow state and stay in that flow state all the way through the finish line.",

The root cause of having lots of filler words or racing in your speaking, is that you probably struggle to feel comfortable slowing down, relaxing, or even pausing when your mind is racing and you feel pressure. Solve that, and not only do the filler words take care of themselves, but the racing takes care of itself and you suddenly have more mind space.",

    "Stay in character and end strong - audiences cannot see your internal nervousness, so leaking insecurities or hedging at the end of your points forces a negative lens onto people who otherwise thought you were doing great.",
    "Practice through deliberate turbulence, not just repetition - games that create pressure and unpredictability build the resilience and adaptability needed for real-world spontaneous speaking scenarios.",
    "Use the Accordion Method and Bow-and-Arrow to prepare talks - compress your content down to its essence through timed spoken reps, then expand back up intentionally, always anchored by the one thing you want your audience to remember."
