    "The psyche of your user matters as much as the product - understand what feels scary or unfamiliar and embed the 'pill in the hot dog' to get users past psychological barriers.",
    "Lower your statistical confidence thresholds to double experiment velocity - in product growth, the risk of not shipping enough experiments is greater than the risk of a false positive.",
    "Carve your own career path by staying close to customers and sharing insights upward - executives lose touch with users and will champion people who bring those insights to life."
