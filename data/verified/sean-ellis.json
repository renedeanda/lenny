    "Customer acquisition should be the last step in a growth strategy, not the first -- optimize activation, engagement, referral, and revenue model before obsessing on channels, because acquisition is too competitive if you can't efficiently convert and retain.",
    "Ignore 'somewhat disappointed' users when iterating on product-market fit -- catering to lukewarm feedback risks diluting the product for must-have users, making it good for everyone but great for no one.",
    "The blend of qualitative and quantitative research produces dramatically better experiments -- talking to customers reveals the context behind the data and helps you ask the right questions at the right time."
