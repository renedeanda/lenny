    "Founder-type engineers matter more than headcount in the AI era - one or two strong technical leads with an idea can move faster than large teams. The ability to compose the right prompts and architect AI-augmented systems is now a specialized, high-value skill.",
    "Don't optimize for Web 2.0 engagement metrics with AI products - time spent, session length, and DAU miss the point. Instead, focus on whether people are unlocking creativity and getting work done they couldn't before. You know it when you see it.",
    "Differentiation beats imitation in crowded AI markets - rather than chasing ChatGPT's consumer adoption, lean into your unique strengths. For Anthropic, that's builders, makers, and hackers who create at the edge of model capabilities."
