And some of these were really tough situations, so then later on, I'd ask why something went wrong. And I get feedback like, you don't understand the situation. Yeah, of course I don't understand this situation because you haven't told me about it. These people on my team thought that being a leader was handling it the best they could given the circumstances when in many cases the right way is to escalate the issue so that perhaps I could help them change the circumstances. I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know.",

What assumptions are you making? Many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, you haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters.",

WhatsApp does the best job of this.

You can't really do a lot of this work alone. If you can get a small team, like two, three people aligned on the importance of something that's deemed un-sexy, it's a lot easier to start to build this game plan around metrics or running small tests or structuring OKRs to not only prioritize this work, but to show some really massive impact.

Refusing to specialize served me well. I thought if I could learn all the skills that would allow me to combine them to work on the most important things versus only work on the thing I knew how to work on.

I still think data network effects are underrated. Leveraging product usage data to make the product value stronger and stronger over time.
