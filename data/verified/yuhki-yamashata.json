    "Customer feedback requires a balanced portfolio -- tweets are canaries in the coal mine, not mandates. Figma created a 'Concerning Tweets' channel to capture weak signals without causing organizational panic.",
    "OKRs often fail because teams either pick metrics they can move but don't matter, or metrics that matter but can't be moved. Good OKRs need three qualities: legibility, actionability, and authenticity.",
