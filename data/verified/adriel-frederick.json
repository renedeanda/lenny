    "When building algorithmic products, PMs must define what algorithms should handle versus what requires human judgment -- algorithms optimize but lack understanding of long-term effects and user intent.",
    "The marginal user framework helps prioritize growth work: find the person on the cusp of converting, observe their experience firsthand, and remove friction rather than relying solely on funnel data.",
    "Diverse teams are not just ethically important but strategically powerful -- having team members who represent your global user base dramatically speeds up product design and reduces the need for external research.",
    "Sustainable growth comes from grinding on fundamentals (findability, onboarding, core actions) rather than relying on clever hacks that provide short-lived spikes.",
    "The most important leadership skills at senior levels are organizational design and empathy -- taking your own shoes off to understand others' motivations before trying to align on shared objectives."
