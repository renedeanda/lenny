    "The product owner role emerged from Scrum as a developer-facing prioritization role, not from product management. When companies conflate the two, product owners end up as tactical backlog managers without customer discovery, experimentation, or strategic skills.",
    "SAFe gives executives a comforting blueprint but creates process overhead that displaces real product work. Every successful SAFe adoption Melissa has seen ended with the company ripping it up and building something custom from the parts that worked.",
    "The most powerful question for outcome-focused teams is: What do we hope will happen when we release this? This single question forces alignment on metrics and creates accountability for whether shipped work actually delivered value.",
    "Digital transformations fail when led by middle managers whose jobs are most threatened by the change. The C-suite must commit to new career ladders, bring in experienced product leaders, and accept that this is a permanent shift in how the company works.",
    "Agile at its core is about moving quickly and delivering customer value. When it becomes a rigid ceremony-driven process, teams end up talking about work about work instead of focusing on what they're actually achieving for customers and the business."
