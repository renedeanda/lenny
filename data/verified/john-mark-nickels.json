    "Balance vision with execution - too much theory leads to beautiful whiteboards nobody builds, too much execution leads to running through the wrong walls.",

    "Define your personal objective function clearly - five years from now you won't care about the slightly better presentation, but you will care about the relationships you built or neglected."
