  "takeaways": [
    "Super apps are overrated - the benefits of lower CAC and cross-selling only materialize when there's a unifying concept customers can grasp; without it, awareness of services plummets even when they're on the homepage.",
    "Brand is the second most important thing in a consumer business after product - it creates identity-level loyalty that discounts and features from competitors cannot erode.",
    "Doing hard things IS the moat - no moat is permanent, but the willingness to build cash vaults, hire security teams, and solve unglamorous operational problems creates compounding advantages competitors won't match.",
    "Founders should do every job in the company badly first to learn what excellence looks like - seeing how bad you are at a role is the fastest way to know what great looks like when hiring.",
    "Don't just copy the playbook from developed markets - Gojek's biggest innovations (branded driver helmets, motorcycle-centric super app) came from solving uniquely local problems rather than cloning Western models."
