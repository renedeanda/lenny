What are the implications of that? I'm an engineer, and engineers are fundamentally pessimistic people. Somebody once told me engineers come into the world broken. They just look at everything as a problem to be solved. But I feel like I've missed out more by being pessimistic than I have by being too optimistic too early.",

But if you look at something like ChatGPT where the entire world is like, 'This is amazing' or 'This is terrible' and there's not a whole lot in between, that's a very good signifier of it being truly impactful and disruptive.",
