    "To-do lists fail because they lack constraints - time-boxing your calendar forces trade-offs and helps you measure productivity by distraction-free focus time rather than checked boxes.",
    "Procrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a character flaw - high performers feel the same uncomfortable urges but use techniques like the 10-minute rule and 'not yet' instead of abstinence.",
    "Indistractable workplaces require psychological safety, forums to discuss problems, and leaders who model focused work - distraction at scale is a symptom of organizational dysfunction."
