    "Soft skills are the future of work - creativity, listening, empathy, and management will become more valuable as AI automates hard skills like coding and writing, because these human capabilities remain difficult for models to replicate.",
    "AI research progress is bottlenecked by management, not intelligence - allocating constrained compute resources to the highest-conviction research paths is a prioritization and leadership challenge.",
    "Agents must build trust over time through collaboration - the paradigm shift from synchronous chat to asynchronous agents requires models that learn user preferences and prove reliability before acting autonomously."
