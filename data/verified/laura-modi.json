    "An ounce of naivety is a founder's secret weapon - not knowing how hard something is frees you from the status quo and enables creative disruption.",
    "D2C isn't dead, but paid marketing addiction is - flip the priority to content, community, then commerce, and make your product and brand do 60% of the growth work.",
    "Manufacture momentum through artificial deadlines and launch dates - if you don't create urgency, projects drift and teams lose energy."
