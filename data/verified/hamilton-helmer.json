Not strategy in the sense of this fully articulated strategic planning. At the earlier stage, the questions are of the business propositions that you're thinking of, what are the underlying characteristics that might tilt them towards the availability of power or not?",

    "Strategy should be considered from day one, not just after product-market fit. Even at the earliest stages, founders should evaluate which business propositions tilt toward the availability of power, not just customer demand.",
    "Most startups begin with counter positioning as their first source of power, because product-market fit is primarily a substitution against incumbents who could otherwise easily extend their capabilities to compete.",
    "Having a flywheel or network effects does not mean you have power. The key test is materiality: whether the effect is strong enough to create meaningfully different margins into the future, not just whether the flywheel exists.",
    "Operational excellence is essential for attaining competitive position but is almost never a durable source of power. Most operational advantages can be mimicked by hiring the right people or consultants, putting you on a treadmill you must run but that does not protect you.",
    "Action is the first principle of business. Strategy frameworks are guideposts, not blueprints. Iconic businesses often achieve greatness through second and third acts that could not have been planned from the start."
