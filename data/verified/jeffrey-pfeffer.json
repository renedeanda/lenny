    "Networking is fundamentally about generosity and connecting people - the broader your network, the more non-redundant knowledge and opportunities flow through you as a broker.",
    "Substance without visibility means nobody knows what you bring - building a personal brand is not self-promotion but the necessary act of being known for your contributions.",
    "Power and autonomy are fundamentally at odds - acquiring power means surrendering control of your time, privacy, and freedom to the demands of the position."
