    "Test the ideal version with manual work - eliminate confounding variables by manually seeding entire schools, providing 24/7 live chat, doing unscalable things to know with certainty whether the product works",
    "Viral social apps require teens (13-18) - invitations drop 20% per year of age, so targeting adults means buying every user with ads and needing massive VC funding for acquisition instead of organic growth",
    "Hypergrowth is absolute chaos - when you hit product-market fit, everything breaks every 3 days, you need ruthless prioritization, and you may need to geofence growth just to keep things online"
