If I'm using PayPal and I'm sending $1,000 to somebody else, there is no way they will not create a PayPal account to accept the $1,000. By me trying to use PayPal in its everyday intention and me getting value out of it, I'm automatically enticing someone else, very strongly so, to also become a customer.",
