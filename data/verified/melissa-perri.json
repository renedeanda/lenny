    "Strategy deployment is the 'missing middle' -- the gap between what executives want (business outcomes) and what teams are building (features). Bridging this gap requires written strategy at every level, from strategic intents to product initiatives to team solutions.",
    "When strategy is well-deployed, trade-off conversations become calm and objective rather than emotional and political. Executives align on shared goals instead of fighting for competing priorities.",
    "Product operations is the emerging discipline that scales product management by standardizing the cross-team interactions -- roadmap formats, strategy check-in cadences, customer research coordination -- while leaving team-level practices autonomous."
