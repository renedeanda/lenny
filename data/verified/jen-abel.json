    "Qualification is the real bottleneck, not closing -- most founders blame bottom-of-funnel conversion when the true problem is reaching the wrong people with the wrong message at the top of the funnel.",
    "Vulnerability unlocks honest feedback -- telling prospects your product is still early (even if it's further along) creates psychological safety that yields more raw and actionable insights than a polished demo.",
    "Selling services before technology is a valid and often necessary strategy -- 40-50% of B2B startups need to offer some form of service engagement to educate buyers and establish a foothold before the technology sale can happen."
