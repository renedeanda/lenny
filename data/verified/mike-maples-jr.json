    "The best insights are earned, not theorized - founders discover secrets by getting their hands dirty at the cutting edge, living in the future, and actively savoring surprises rather than seeking validation for what they already believe.",
    "Startups should embrace disagreeableness and chaos as features, not bugs. You can't stand out if you always fit in, and every startup on the inside is messy - the key is channeling that chaos into a movement that draws early believers toward a radically different future.",
    "Pattern-breaking founders are storytellers who position themselves as the mentor (Obi-Wan), not the hero (Luke) - making early believers the heroes of a transformational journey from the world that is to the world that could be."
