    "Companies are math equations - no amount of great product execution can overcome a fundamentally broken business model, as demonstrated by Quibi's billion-dollar content bet that required top-10 app store placement from day one.",

    "Authentic customer engagement beats polished branding - at Pandora, routing all support emails to every employee and letting people respond as real humans, not a brand, catalyzed the word of mouth that grew the product to 80 million users with zero paid acquisition.",
    "Big swings require financial architecture that supports them - learning from Evan Spiegel at Snap, Tom came to appreciate that speculative bets on features and technologies need investor relationships and capital structures that can absorb the inevitable misses.",
    "Celebrate output over performative hustle - building a sustainable culture means rewarding the person who ships great work in focused hours over the one who is celebrated for working through the night, because sustained excellence requires balance."
