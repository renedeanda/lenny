There was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. It was almost as if there was a strategy gene that you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot. The answer is yes, anybody can build product strategy through a clear understanding of what it is and through a friendly and repeatable playbook.",
