But if you want to start managing groups of PMs, if you want to start running a business unit, or a pillar, or a theme. I as a chief product officer, I'm going to expect you to be able to write that strategy doc without me. A lot of people couldn't do that step. And that means when you try to become a product leader at the company and the CEO expects that from you and you can't do it, you're going to set yourself up to really cap hard on how fast your career can grow. That's definitely where I've seen the biggest bottleneck in terms of skill sets. That one to get to the top is the great filter.",
