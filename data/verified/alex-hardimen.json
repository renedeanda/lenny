    "Wartime product leadership requires blowing up roadmaps and reallocating resources instantly when the moment demands it, as the NYT did during COVID when they built a public data set no one else was creating.",
    "Scaling editorial judgment through algorithms trained on journalist-generated quality signals is fundamentally different from optimizing purely for engagement metrics, and produces more trustworthy products.",
    "Business goals should serve the mission, not the other way around - measuring impact through both subscriber growth and real-world outcomes like policy changes creates a more meaningful definition of product success."
