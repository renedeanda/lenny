    "Most people are steered toward becoming reaction machines optimized for inbox zero and fast responses, but this reactive mode prevents meaningful Project A work from ever happening.",
    "Your calendar should be a design tool, not something done to you -- blocking focus time, personal activities, and even meals creates structure that protects your most important work.",
    "Treat each day as an experiment rather than a pass/fail test -- the reflect step of looking back with curiosity rather than judgment creates a sustainable improvement loop."
