    "Direct, early feedback accelerates performance - share uncomfortable truths within weeks of someone joining, paired with genuine belief in their potential and an offer to support them.",
    "Growth should be infused into the company from the start, not layered on top. The best execution comes from starting with user-centric hypotheses rather than copying best practices from other companies.",
    "First principles thinking is the most valuable skill in growth: knowing what questions to ask, forming your own mental models from context, and staying curious enough to constantly revisit whether you're doing the right things."
