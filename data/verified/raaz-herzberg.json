    "True product-market fit is unmistakable - when customers start asking about pricing, pushing for POVs, and connecting you to their teams, that pull is qualitatively different from polite interest and 'sounds interesting' feedback.",

    "Founders must do the job end-to-end before hiring someone to do it - Wiz's founding team closed millions in deals themselves before hiring salespeople, because if the core team can't do it, an outside hire won't magically solve the problem.",
    "Follow the heat within your organization - as a company scales, the critical bottleneck shifts from product to engineering to sales to marketing, and the best leaders move to wherever the most urgent organizational need is.",
    "Product messages must be crystal clear to scale - what works as fluffy, gray context inside the product team gets completely lost in translation when it crosses to marketing, sales, and customers. Simplicity is the prerequisite for scale."
