    "Quality metrics should balance growth metrics as your north star - at Airbnb Experiences, review rate trumped bookings, and at Etsy, adding friction to onboarding actually accelerated seller success by improving first-sale speed.",
    "Strategy built in a vacuum fails regardless of how good it is - bring your team along in crafting it so they feel ownership, but maintain one clear decision-maker because good product work is not democratic.",
    "Use the one-way vs two-way door framework to calibrate decision speed - give teams autonomy to cruise on reversible decisions while investing time in irreversible ones that cascade through your system.",
    "Second order thinking is the most important muscle a PM can build - every decision cascades through your ecosystem, and aligning on first principles early saves massive rework later.",
    "Track your energy with a red/yellow/green calendar system to understand what work gives you life - optimize your PM career for the type of product work that energizes you, not just prestigious company names."
