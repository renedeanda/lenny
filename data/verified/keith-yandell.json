    "Create mandatory constructive feedback loops in one-on-ones and then visibly action the feedback - talking about valuing feedback without following through destroys trust.",
    "Tough times are a feature, not a bug - they reveal who's truly mission-driven, force unit economics discipline, and create a singularity of focus that talented people crave.",
    "Compound velocity wins markets - pushing a roadmap up by even one week repeatedly creates an exponential advantage over competitors who are always one step behind."
