    "The best way to build a successful newsletter is years of consistent writing before you monetize, following Jeff Atwood's advice of writing regularly for two years",
    "When you notice strong pull from an audience toward something you created, double down on it immediately rather than sticking to your original plan",
    "Building depth and credibility in a specific field before starting a newsletter is more important than any growth tactic - genuine expertise creates lasting value"
