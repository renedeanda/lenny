    "Context, no control is TikTok's core operating principle - give people full visibility into the business so they think like owners, then encourage proactive thinking with reactive doing to avoid stepping on toes while breaking down silos.",
    "Cross-functional closeness between engineering, product, and sales is a secret weapon - TikTok keeps these teams unusually close through reading-format meetings with 180+ people and immersion trips where PMs and engineers meet clients directly.",
    "Hiring speed should never compromise quality - compromising hiring standards to grow fast creates teams that actually move slower, and wrong-fit employees slow everyone down rather than accelerating the organization.",
    "Understanding local culture is essential for global products - technology and algorithms do heavy lifting, but you must invest in local talent and on-the-ground market understanding to fine-tune products for different cultures.",
    "Digital advertising is fundamentally about discovery, not just targeting - TikTok positions itself as a digital version of word-of-mouth, where the content graph enables advertisers to reach new audiences through test-and-learn approaches rather than narrow targeting."
