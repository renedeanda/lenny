    "The creator economy hamster wheel is real — platforms need to find ways to smooth out revenue and reduce the burden of constant content creation for creators to sustain their livelihoods",

    "Consistency and predictability of content creation has been the number one success factor for creators since the early YouTube days in 2010, and it remains true today",
    "The role of curator as creator is undervalued — in a world drowning in content, trusted tastemakers who can filter and recommend have enormous value",
    "De-risk your biggest swings first in product discovery — constantly deferring high-risk innovations in favor of safe bets ensures you never truly break through"
