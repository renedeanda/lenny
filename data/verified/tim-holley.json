    "A clear north star metric (GMS) transformed Etsy's culture from consensus-paralysis to focused execution -- rallying everyone around a single KPI that serves as the drumbeat in every meeting and the measuring stick for every launch.",

    "Deep seller immersion through studio visits, workshops, and hack weeks built Etsy's foundational understanding of supply-side needs, and the marketplace now uses its aggregate data advantage to help individual sellers make better business decisions.",
    "A/B testing is the highest bar for validation but it can miss the point for bigger bets -- Etsy is expanding beyond pure experimentation to cohort analysis and other methods that better capture longer-horizon value like retention.",
    "The PM is not the mini CEO but is ultimately accountable for choosing the best ideas from cross-functional partners and owning the consequences, including learning from the 80% of experiments that fail."
