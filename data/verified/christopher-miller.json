    "If your growth experiments succeed more than 30-40% of the time, you're thinking too small — resilience and willingness to fail are prerequisites for meaningful growth work",
    "PLG is not synonymous with fully self-service — the most successful product-led companies use a hybrid approach where humans serve as backstops at key moments in the customer journey",
    "Radical accountability means treating every problem as your problem — HubSpot's growth team found their biggest wins by adopting neglected code bases and initiatives nobody was working on",
    "Distinguish between business problems and customer problems — if there's a negative business metric, trace it back to the underlying customer problem before building solutions",
    "Give value before extracting value — HubSpot's flywheel evolved from free content marketing to free software, but the principle remained the same: earn trust through genuine value first"
