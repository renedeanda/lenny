    "Building in India requires completely different strategies than Western markets: low ARPU demands multi-product approaches, low trust creates super apps, time is valued differently (no hourly wages), and profit pools reveal what cultures actually value versus what founders assume.",

    "Indian immigrant CEOs succeed by maintaining founder 'dharma' (principles) rather than imposing their own identity - they balance being Krishna (high values, low obedience for crisis) and Rama (high values, high obedience for scaling) without diluting core company values.",
    "Entrepreneurs are uncertainty absorbers who get rewarded for removing ambiguity from employees, investors, and customers - but the best ones also learn from others' failures because life is too short to make every mistake yourself."
