    "Marketing technology is fundamentally a product management discipline focused on systems and platforms -- not just picking third-party tools, but architecting solutions that combine bought and built components.",

    "Future-proof your data infrastructure from day one by collecting first and last UTM attribution data on users and events, so you're ready for multi-touch attribution when the time comes.",
    "In a post-IDFA world, marketers must become comfortable making decisions with probabilistic rather than deterministic data, using models built from partial population data to extrapolate insights.",
    "The 'thinking gray' philosophy -- deliberately delaying decisions as long as possible before you must decide -- leads to better outcomes in systems design, hiring, and leadership."
