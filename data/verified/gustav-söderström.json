So you make a prediction. But if you were wrong, it needs to be super easy for the user say, \"No, you're wrong, I want to go to my library or to this or to that.\" So we have that principle of having fault-tolerant user interface and a user interface that corresponds to the current performance of your algorithms.",

We actually acquired big companies and so forth to be able to build it. But the idea had been built by teams bottom up. So the principle there was literally to do as little as possible and get out of the way. And I think that was really helpful.

Instead of having one person in the company think, you have on the VP level this many tens to maybe hundreds of people that have a lot of autonomy to think. So you get a good amount of freedom of thought and people thinking in different directions, but it's not like 8,000 people. And these people on the VP level are usually quite senior.

But when you redesign, it is much more tricky because it's not voluntary to participate in the redesign. So there's a cost even for people who don't like it. Then you have a very tricky problem, which is there are going to be two types of feedback. One is you did something and it was right, but people are upset because you changed stuff. The other is you did something and it wasn't right, and people are also upset but for good reasons.",

    "Product development should be 100% science and 0% magic. If you cannot explain a product decision clearly, you probably do not understand it yourself. Forcing explanation is the best way to ensure real understanding and to share knowledge across the organization."
