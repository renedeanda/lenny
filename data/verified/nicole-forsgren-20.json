    "Start improving developer experience by listening, not building tools - go talk to developers about their day-to-day friction points, and you'll often find low-lift process changes that have outsized impact.",
    "AI is reshaping flow states by making shorter work blocks productive - machines can help developers re-enter flow by providing context, generating diagrams, and handling the mechanical aspects of coding.",
    "Treat developer experience as a product with a PM mindset - identify problems for specific users, build MVPs, get fast feedback, iterate rapidly, and know when to sunset metrics and tools that no longer serve their purpose."
