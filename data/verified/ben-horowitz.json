And if you can break psychologically, you can take the sunk cost, then that gets you out of a lot of bad paths. A small good decision may be difficult, but you have to believe it's going to lead to the next one. A lot of success is about that. It's a small thing, a small thing that's hard to do that doesn't seem to have a high impact, but it leads to the next small hard to do thing.",
