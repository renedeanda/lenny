I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do, and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. That doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job?",

    "Company clarity comes from focused direction - everyone rowing together in the same direction beats distributed empowerment that creates politics and bureaucracy.",
    "Small, expert teams beat large generalist ones - Airbnb has 7,000 employees vs Uber's 30,000, and leaders must be domain experts who manage the work first, people second.",
    "The CEO should be the chief product officer in product-led companies - delegating away your core strength as a founder creates the conditions for organizational decay."
