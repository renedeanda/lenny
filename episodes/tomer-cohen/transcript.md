# How LinkedIn became interesting: The inside story | Tomer Cohen (CPO at LinkedIn)

## Transcript

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):
I think it's so underappreciated, the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I check it at least 10 times a day. What was the strategy behind it?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:06):
I start backwards. It's like what is the potential here? If you start from the premise that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):
Is there anything tactically that would just like, wow, that really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post, share interesting content?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:25):
To really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products. This is not a traffic jumpstart, it's not an upsell feed. It's really about people that matter, talking about things that I care about professionally. The first thing we did was really making AI first.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):
How do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:43):
So it wasn't like, "Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?" It was like, "Let go of what you've built. Go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?"

Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):
There's so much I want to dig into here. Is there anything else that you think would be interesting or useful for folks?

Tomer Cohen (00:00:57):
AI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's really about...

Lenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):
Today my guest is Tomer Cohen. Tomer is chief product officer at LinkedIn overseeing all teams responsible for building and creating LinkedIn products and experiences, including product development, design, business development, content creation, and customer operations. During his tenure at LinkedIn, Tomer was head of the mobile team, led the effort to revamp the LinkedIn feed and to many people surprised, made it extremely interesting in a place I check regularly. And he was also at the center of shifting LinkedIn to an AI first mindset, which started way before AI became cool. In our conversation, Tomer goes inside the strategy behind the transformation of LinkedIn's feed and how they approached making it a place that people wanted to check and make it much more social.

(00:01:49):
We also get into the one mindset that Tomer credits for helping him rise so quickly within LinkedIn. Also, why Tomer's most repeated mantra is, "We might be wrong, but we are not confused." And so much more. This episode is for anyone wanting to see what great product leadership looks like and wants to be inspired to think bigger. A big thank you to Shira Gasarch, Dan Roth, Josh Redfern, and Sparsh Argawal for question suggestions that made this episode so interesting. With that, I bring you Tomer Cohen.

(00:02:24):
Tomer, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:27):
Thank you for having me.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):
Absolutely, my pleasure. So as I was preparing for this podcast, I reached out to a bunch of people that have worked with you and asked them what I should ask you on this podcast, and interestingly, every single one of them said this one thing that I need to ask you, which is about this phrase that apparently you use all the time. So first of all, can you guess what this phrase might be?

Tomer Cohen (00:02:47):
I have a few. Sometimes people call them Tomerisms.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):
Tomerisms.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:50):
But probably I might be wrong but not confused.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:02:54):
That's the one. Amazing. Okay, so let's talk about this phrase.

Tomer Cohen (00:02:58):
I don't say it so much anymore. I think it's ingrained into the cultures.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:02):
I was going to say that.

Tomer Cohen (00:03:03):
When they think of me, they think of this sentence already.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:04):
Those are the ultimate things where you don't need to say them as much anymore. Okay, so the phrase again is, "We might be wrong but we're not confused."

Tomer Cohen (00:03:10):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:03:11):
Let's talk about this. So what does this phrase mean and why do you find it so powerful and important to say often?

Tomer Cohen (00:03:17):
Yeah, by the way, it's a simple phrase, but it has in my opinion, so much depth into that and ultimately something I really believe in. It's rooted in clarity and principles that ultimately lead to leadership. And the first time I got the inspiration from it was from a startup founder I met many, many years ago. Their company was on the brink of failure. They had their last attempt and they decided on a path forward and after they decided on a path forward, he was still seeing people hedging in different directions and it led into this confusion in the system where we decided people are still hedging, they're still trying out things they thought could work, and he realized that unless they basically all pull through in the same direction, there is no chance they'll be able to be successful.

(00:04:04):
Now, pulling through in the same direction doesn't mean you're going to be successful, but this gives you a chance of success and that confusion, the system only luck and save you. So that was when he shared that, that was very impactful for me. I think it's a good one for life as well. And for me it comes down to two main parts. One is clarity of thought and clarity of execution, and they're both equally important.

Tomer Cohen (00:06:46):
On the clarity of thought. What I find people to be attached to, especially when you build an environment with a lot of alpha types is that they get attached to being right or wrong and that really creates a lot of lingering in the system, a lot of confusion and they're still stuck to their ideas. And for me, I get attached to clarity and focus. I think that's much more important. That's why I think when I say I don't mind being wrong, it really comes from a humble place. I would rather go forward with everybody in the same direction than necessarily try to hedge all the time, which will give me no chance of success. The way we start, we do this in our product gens right now, is we actually spend some significant time on what is the problem we're trying to solve for, but not high level, not like, hey, we want to launch this product, we want to launch a video product.

(00:07:35):
It's exactly what type of video you're trying to launch for which audience, what is your unique criteria, what are you trying, what is very nuanced about what you're trying to solve for? Ideally, once the time you see the problem, you know exactly the problem you're trying, you actually can imagine that mountain. It's not just a mountain, you can see exactly the road, you can see exactly the end of the base camp. But then when you move to solution, I love solutions that are based on first principles. That they have, there's a principle thinking about it, there's opinions about it. If you talk to folks who work with me, they'll tell you, I push a lot for what is actually your opinion, what is your potentially controversial opinion and the best principles have teeth.

(00:08:18):
So saying that we should build a simple product for me is useless. Who doesn't want to build a simple product? But saying that I'm willing to sacrifice or trade off this, that's where I get excited. I'm like, okay, that's a very strong opinion. Let's go into that. Why were you willing to trade off those type of vectors to make it happen? And one thing that I saw also in clarity of thought was this, is I came to the US in 2008, I came from Israel. Our hobby in Israel is to argue. So we argue a lot, it's our love language in many ways. And I come to the US and I notice people say a lot like I don't exactly understand or I'm not exactly clear on this, and it took me a long time to realize they're actually disagreeing.

(00:09:03):
They're just masking it with a layer of misunderstanding and a good mentor of mine said, "Hey, just push back. Are you disagreeing or misunderstanding? If you're misunderstanding, let's spend the night. Let's get to a point where you can articulate my point of view in your words and I can do the same, but if we're disagreeing, let's stop. Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, "Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative." And then I'll say, "But most of your engineers are working on this migration." And they'll say, "Yeah, we have to finish that." I'm like, "So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?" It's like, "Yeah."

(00:10:09):
It's like, but that's exactly what you're doing. You have to make sure that what you're sharing as a priority is actually manifested in your resourcing. Then I'm like, "Hey, this is your top talent. Why is your top talent working on some moonshots that are not in your number one priority?" And they're like, "Yeah." This is where you start finding that really it doesn't really translate into execution as well and you can solve so much by just making that sure that focus is there.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:10:36):
So the big lesson here is to push for clarity and push out anything that is unclear, confusion either in thought and also in execution. One of the folks that I talked to that worked with you about this phrase, Josh Redfern, he said that this phrase became really liberating for him, which is really interesting to hear because it forces you to make a call and to be aligned and make sure everyone is on the same page. I guess thoughts on just why this concept is so liberating.

Tomer Cohen (00:11:04):
It goes back to little alpha types or type A folks who are just so attached to not getting it wrong. When you need to move forward and it's not about being right or wrong, it's really about not being confused and making sure everybody's pulling in the same direction. That is actually really liberating. And when you know that the whole idea is to have a Socratic conversation about what you're trying to do, then coming to the table with some kind of half-baked ideas or actually not an opinion, I think actually brings into a conversation of feedback.

(00:11:39):
But you have to manifest it through, if you just play this through but then you potentially playing the right or wrong game, that's really poor. I also think it's the best way to learn. If you don't know exactly what you're doing, how can you learn back from why you made that decision? So if you had a clear understanding, ultimately it's a growing organization. This is not a one-off project. We're going to build many projects in the future. So if you're not sure about what we're trying to accomplish, how can you know what you learned from it?

Lenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):
I love that. So the idea here is make it very okay to be wrong, but make it not okay to be confused and not clear about here's what we're doing, here's why we're doing it. Everyone's aligned exactly on the same idea.

Tomer Cohen (00:12:19):
How can I have a product conversation if I'm not sure what you stand for? It's really hard to have a Socratic conversation, really hard to have. If you ask folks how many time you left a meeting in corporate, it could be a startup or larger companies and you are not sure exactly what was the problem discussed or what are next steps. More often than not, they'll raise their hand. That for me is a waste of building time. So actually that agitates me in another great way, but when I come in and I'm proven wrong or there's a strong challenge or argument, again that's a little bit my love language, I actually enjoy those. I think we leave the conversation much better.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:13:09):
You said there's some other Tomerisms, what are some others just that you can share?

Tomer Cohen (00:13:14):
This is, again, this is classic to building large organizations, but I actually believe in, especially when it comes to products, to really set ambitious goals but then try to over-deliver on them, really set what are you trying to, there's almost like the opposite where people are underplaying it and over delivering, I don't understand what you're trying to do. For me it's like we are here to make an impact. We're here to really set our goals to something really massive. And when I'm trying to visualize this, I see a mountain, you see the peak and the peak exactly how it looks like, you see base camp, you know how to start and maybe the middle of the mountain is kind of blurry, but you'll figure this out. But at least you know the peak you're trying to share, share the peak, share where you're headed to and I think it's just a much more exciting way to build product. It's a much more inspirational way for folks to be part of the product process kind of thing.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:14:07):
I was just chatting with Vlad who worked at Airbnb for many years. He was actually my former manager at Airbnb and he reported to Brian for a long time and we talked about this trait that Brian also is really good at, is just setting crazy high goals. 10 X the goal that you thought you had and what would it take and it worked really well for Airbnb. So I love that you're doubling down on the same idea. Is there an example that comes to mind of one that you, some ambitious goal you set internally at LinkedIn that people are like, "No way," and then it ended up being effective?

Tomer Cohen (00:14:35):
Actually there's a lot, when I think about our LinkedIn feed and thinking about when you started off, it was hard to imagine what that product could be because it was more of a promotional in nature product and I was like, no, is going to be a place where millions of people and not just tens of millions will come daily. And that's insane. That makes no sense based on the numbers today, but I don't start building from the numbers today. I start from [inaudible 00:15:04] I start backwards. I'm like, what this could be, what is the potential here? So how many professionals exist in their role? How many of them would love to find a place to share and engage with content? And this is my starting point. I start from there. So I don't start from the existence to set my ambition. I start from what this could be like based on really inspiration and excitement.

(00:15:30):
Again, it's not detached from reality completely, but it's also not hooked to it. But then Basecamp could be a good start. You're not asking you to make it the next day, but if you don't have that ambition, there's no way you're going to hit that. There's just no way. And there's so many products across LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a 20 plus year old company that many folks did not give it a chance in almost every phase of it. And I think if anything, it's one of those that just keeps getting better and better every year. And part of it is you keep the landmark on. This really has the potential to do so much for so many people. It's really an economic platform. So if you play from that, one billion members, that's actually pretty small where we can actually go,

Lenny Rachitsky (00:16:17):
I'm so happy you went to this example. This is exactly where I wanted to take the conversation. I was very much in the camp you described of LinkedIn, how could LinkedIn possibly become a place that I want to go and browse a feed and post content? As you probably know, for the longest time it was felt like this cringey place as you said, where everyone comes and promotes themselves, "Hey, I got a promotion or here's my company's new launch." And I think it's so underappreciated the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I use it, I'm a multi-day, multi-Dow user. I check it at least 10 times a day. Most of my traffic to my newsletter comes from LinkedIn, not Twitter where people think, it's absurdly underappreciated and it's I think underappreciated what it took to make this happen.

(00:17:02):
And when I saw you guys starting to try to make it a place people post content, I was like, no way, this is not going to work. Why would people want to share stuff on LinkedIn? And it's working, it's amazing. So I want to spend some time here and just try to go inside the strategy that you guys put together to here's how we're going to make this happen. Come, we've shared, you have this peak of here's what we could become. How did you actually turn this around? What was the strategy behind it?

Tomer Cohen (00:17:26):
Yeah, by the way, I'm glad you're finding great audience and traffic on LinkedIn. I think your content, actually, your content is exactly what we're trying to build for, it's expertise, it's advice, it's people you can learn from and it's also the views that really matter, not just the volume that matters. I think if we take a step back, there's so much conversation about zero to one products or scaling products, but you don't have much conversations about minus one to one products, like turnaround products. And I think there's obviously the perception of the market you have to deal with, but people I think in minus to one products, at least from my experience and we had a few at LinkedIn, pages is another one, helping businesses build their presence on LinkedIn. What you find is it's actually, most of the time it's internally harder to do because there's so much entrenched flows and processes and metrics that people are using on that specific area.

(00:18:21):
So you almost have to change the inner workings of the system to make it work. Going back to the analogy of the mountain, if you start from the premise that I deeply believe in is that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Then really almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible and knowledge transaction is one of the most powerful economic transactions you can have. It's the biggest accelerant for an experience and we were always very strong at helping people get a job. We have seven hires per minute, but as we were building more and more knowledge and part of it was we bought LinkedIn, we bought Lynda to make it LinkedIn Learning a while back. Today we had 140 hours of learning every minute on LinkedIn happening across the feed and LinkedIn Learning, it's pretty powerful.

(00:19:13):
And the transformation to the LinkedIn feed was exactly like you said. We actually were the first company to have a social feed, but I think we started wrong. So we started with basically activity feed. So it was like who changed what, who changed the job, who connected to who. It was more of like a tracking your network feed and it became more promotional in nature. So in a way just letting that be just naturally just moved into more of a promotional type of feed. And what we've done is we've shifted dramatically into building, actually this was one of the things I was excited about. So after I was leading the mobile team, there was no feed team, there was no unified feed team, there was no feed PM to an extent, I asked to do this role, nobody cared about it. I really believed in it.

(00:20:07):
I have strong conviction about what I could do there. And I asked to do this role and we assembled the team around it and one of the main things we've done was to really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products, this is not a traffic jumpstart for, it's not an app self feed, it's really about people that matter talking about things that I care about professionally. It's about knowledge exchange. It's about how can I get the right views to the right experts in a way that actually helps them build a reputation and build their business. And then we started from there backwards. So it was basically setting that ground for that mountain peak that was nowhere to be imagined at the beginning and making our way backwards.

(00:20:55):
The first thing we did was really making AI first. So the AI team back then was completely centralized. It was not part of any product team and we brought it together with one unified AI first team. And the belief I had was ultimately the engine of the car was AI and that was almost like de-prioritized or delegated to a team that was not unified in objectives. So bring that in. And then I spent most of my time on objectives and algorithm features and data training, which led me into my passion about training product people to be a first product people. And that was a big transformation there, really shifting and we had incredible AI team, but they were completely, actually, it was a confused operation. They were building something for a whole different purpose and we were trying to aim to that mountain peak and they were putting in a different direction. No bad intent, that's what they were told to do.

(00:21:56):
So bringing it together into this SWAT team was the first thing that actually was extremely powerful, but then became the hard work. You have a product that works in a certain way and you almost want to change its DNA altogether. And it was very hard because whenever we were trying to run experiments that were mass in scale, I told you everybody was relying on the feed for their traffic. It just scared the whole system because numbers were shifting up and down and teams were freaking out about meeting their goals. And then I realized that was just spending my time in escalations instead of actually building a great product. So what I did was I carved out two million members and I said, "Those are my members. I'm going to focus on building that mountain peak. I'm going to build for them."

(00:22:45):
Full liberty and doing whatever, it doesn't hurt numbers, giving the scale and really focus on building a great experience for them. And it wasn't overnight and it wasn't over a week, but over the course of months we've seen dramatic behavior change for those members, almost like secluded, like a country of people that were seeing a different experience of LinkedIn. And once we saw that you actually had strong evidence that wow, if I bring this in, we don't need to spend time talking about how this pie gets slotted between different teams. We can actually grow the pie. The experience just manifests itself in a whole different way and that was a big change internally. It wasn't overnight, but it was really powerful in getting everybody around to see, wow, we have this cohort that is doing extremely well, which was a randomized cohort and then how we can bring it out.

(00:23:39):
I've also done some crazy things. We've done some negative tests to prove some stuff out, test for the sake of learning. When you run something that you can show that if it's just a promotional feed and you played it out organically over time, engage with the tier rates. We ran some really important ad tests as well, but we're really shown separate, almost like we carved out the different product and we showed that this could work and then we brought it out to the main experience for everybody else. And then that was, I would say the inner workings of minus one to one. Then the scanning part really became when we started to focus on professional opportunities. So when people actually share, how do they get the right views into the experience?

(00:24:19):
We don't compete for volume, we're not in the same category of Meta in terms of the skill there, but we will compete all day long for the right people seeing your content. In fact, I think in many ways that's the most powerful part of LinkedIn. How do we make sure that it's professionally productive and safe conversations? How do we trade off bad engagement all day long? In fact, when we started shifting the AI objective from click through into more downstream conversations, spammers actually took notice as well. So they were jumping over the LinkedIn bandwagon, so we had to spend a lot of time removing bad activity from LinkedIn, but that's been the evolution of this process.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):
That is amazing. There's so much I want to dig into here. Okay, so this two million user carve out that you did, basically everyone was just like, what the hell are you doing to our metrics and goals? You're causing all this trouble for the business. Why is this team hurting our metrics? So that was basically a group that those two million users are the only ones that saw this new updated feed and were they removed from everyone else's metrics so they weren't fluctuated as much or was it just?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:26):
They could be kept in the overall because it wasn't as important.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):
It was a small percent?

Tomer Cohen (00:25:30):
Exactly.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):
Okay. Got it.

Tomer Cohen (00:25:30):
But for us, they were like the world we were basically able to prove with them.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):
Got it. Okay. That's so smart. Okay, so basically you just decided we're only going to move your metrics a little bit, worst case if we stick to it.

Tomer Cohen (00:25:41):
I felt that I tried for a few months to play on the overall experience with everybody, but it was really hard, almost like impossible because you have an organization that is so tied into how things work that I was just hitting walls after walls after escalations and it was just unproductive.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:00):
And this is before you were a chief product officer where you could have just said, "We will take this bet. We know this might hurt metrics short-term"?

Tomer Cohen (00:26:06):
Yes.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:07):
Okay, got it. That makes sense. Okay, the other piece, so just like lessons I'm taking away from trying something like this that's an ambitious bet within a company, is put a PM and a team on it with a goal that feels like a core part of the success of just like somebody's ass is on the line to doing this thing.

Tomer Cohen (00:26:23):
Always.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):
Always, with focus on this one problem. And then there's the way you described there's this goal for this feed, but how did you actually try to turn that into a goal or metric or a KPI, what was that in the end, was there something there?

Tomer Cohen (00:26:35):
Yeah, this is an interesting one, one thing we've done actually because the feed is the first thing you land on. I can't just count how many folks engage with the feed because then I'm counting bypassers kind of thing and bystanders that are actually coming into the experience. So we actually started to look at the more, we go a lot into active, engaged and high value engagement. So we go downstream, we kind of put the onus on looking at more downstream engagement there and we build that as the feed engagement. So really trying to show that we're not just counting some overall whatever it is [inaudible 00:27:09] or sessions at the top level. That's not really helpful because any shifts can help there, but really setting targets for that. There's obviously it's a marketplace, so there's the creation side, there's the consumption side's, there's making sure that's healthy and engaging.

(00:27:23):
There was so much we went into that, but I think the best thing was it's almost like you carve out. I think when you do minus one to one, it's really hard unless the CEO says I don't care about how the company performs for the next two years, we're going to go for it. If you want to keep the site keep growing and the experience keep growing, carving out and almost like sending very specific unique metrics but then could easily be extended out once you show it was in retrospect the right way to do it.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):
And then to give people a glimpse into the way your brain works to identify this is a big opportunity. So you talk about just like I see there's a lever that we're not investing enough in and I see this big opportunity to grow of LinkedIn. How did you decide I need to go and bet on this thing and lead this team and I think feed is a huge opportunity?

Tomer Cohen (00:28:10):
I start from beliefs a lot. So I start from what do I believe this could be or where I actually came to LinkedIn this way. In fact my biggest change in my career was when I moved here and I shifted to more like what do I care about? What am I excited about? What do I have conviction on? I think it's really hard to be a strong product leader without having strong conviction about something. So I start there and in fact coming to LinkedIn as an example, when I came into lead mobile, LinkedIn was a desktop first company, then mobile team was an offshoot of entrepreneurs. I came from a startup that I ran and it wasn't a big, it wasn't, it was like, okay, I want to do mobile, I guess fine. It's like noise at this point. Same with feed. And same when I shifted into ads, I felt really strong about the ability to flip that into a great way for companies to grow.

(00:29:04):
So for me it starts with a conviction of where things could go, what do I believe in? I believe LinkedIn can be an incredible superpower and daily use case for every professional in the world. I believe knowledge sharing and knowledge exchange is the most amazing way to grow your career and to grow your business. So that needs to be a strong pillar of the experience, what didn't exist before and what is better than the feed experience, the home [inaudible 00:29:32] to actually build it. So I don't get attached to what did not work in the past. That's not, I don't know, maybe it's a mistake sometimes, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about the future.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):
How do you actually make time to think like this? A lot of people are listening. They're just like, "Okay, I want to think about what could this become?" Is this just the way brain works? You're always thinking what could this be? Do you set time aside to think quarterly or yearly, what could this be if we really made this amazing?

Tomer Cohen (00:30:02):
It's a good question. I haven't thought about it. It's like a process I do. I don't sit time aside for this, but I'm very reflective. I try to focus, love the conversations on the dream, what ultimately are we trying to achieve? I think LinkedIn has a great process called vision to values that started from our former CEO, Jeff Winner, which is like if you said this is for company or for a product, which is if you're successful, what change would happen in the world? Which I love. It's just a great phrase. It's just a great empowering phrase. So I actually tend to spend a lot of my time there. I'm also very optimistic in nature. Again, sometimes it's probably, I'm not best for any role perspective. You want somebody a bit more pessimistic about the future, but I tend to lead with beliefs versus evidence. I try to prove my beliefs with evidence, but I don't lead with evidence.

Lenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):
Love that. Final question, just to come back to LinkedIn. Is there a fun feature of LinkedIn people don't know about or should check out? Is there anything new that's like, oh, that's something you should try or that's something that might surprise you about LinkedIn these days?

Tomer Cohen (01:04:19):
Maybe I'll give a couple so I don't have to pick the best right off the bat. But one right now, we're heavily invested in video and it's doing so well for those creators. We talked about it like immersive video we can actually come in. We talked about for us, video is obviously a best practice right now in the industry, but on LinkedIn, the right views really matter. So highly encourage creators to think about their video play at LinkedIn. And then I think what we call our coach experience in some cases is so powerful. For job seekers out there, we have people hired on LinkedIn, there's like seven folks hired every minute. Job seeking is a lonely journey.

(01:05:02):
I was actually in a session recently meeting with job seekers and I was talking to them and one started crying midway into the session because they said, "I cannot share my journey with anybody because I feel like I'm alone in this. People don't get how hard it is. I feel very accomplished, but I can't get the job. And I wish there was a buddy, I wish there was something that I could talk to brainstorm with who wouldn't judge me, who would just be trying to help me without paying hundreds of dollars to a coach of some sort. I don't have that money."

(01:05:38):
And in many ways, when we walked him through the job seeking experience, the coach experience, we build this coach aspect where you can go to any job and you can riff on the job with this really new realities LLM that is tailored to you, personalized to you, private to you, everything from your fit to how to best apply, to consulting about different opportunities, to comparing this to others, to feeling supported. So when we talk to people around, we always, I love to measure the impact of our work by emotion, when we talk to job seekers after that, it was basically the sense of I felt supported. In many ways, getting to that ability to remove the loneliness is amazing. It's a little bit like people need to, we're making it more and more visible and more and more ramped to everybody to a certain point. But that's a really powerful way to just humanize the job seeking experience for everybody.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):
Awesome. And to find that it's just, is it called LinkedIn Coach or?

Tomer Cohen (01:06:40):
It's in the job. So if you go to the job tab on LinkedIn, actually just a few weeks ago, we just put it on the top. So you don't have to go to the specific job and find it, you can just start there and engage with it.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):
Awesome. Tomer, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. You're awesome.

Tomer Cohen (01:08:07):
Awesome. So obviously I'm on LinkedIn, reach out anytime. I read everything people send to me. I don't always reply to everything, but I read everything sent to me. And then if you want to go deep on AI first, I have two courses, they're free. I think it's a phenomenal way for you to build or starting to build your expertise, especially if you're in product. It's a great way to go deeper and not just stay on the high level parts of things.

Lenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):
Amazing. We'll link to all those things in the show notes. Tomer, thank you so much for being here.

Tomer Cohen (01:08:40):
